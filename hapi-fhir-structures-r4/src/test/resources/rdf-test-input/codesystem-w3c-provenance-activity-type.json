Thus, heterogeneous systems can export their native provenance into such a core data model, and applications that need to make sense of provenance can then import it, process it, and reason over it.\n\tA key goal of PROV is the specification of a machine-processable data model for provenance. However, communicating provenance between humans is also important when teaching, illustrating, formalizing, and discussing provenance-related issues.  With these two requirements in mind, this document introduces PROV-N, the PROV notation, a syntax designed to write instances of the PROV data model according to the following design principles: •Technology independence. PROV-N provides a simple syntax that can be mapped to several technologies. \n\t•Human readability. PROV-N follows a functional syntax style that is meant to be easily human-readable so it can be used in illustrative examples, such as those presented in the PROV documents suite. \n\t•Formality. PROV-N is defined through a formal grammar amenable to be used with parser generators.\u0026quot;\n\t\t\u003chr/\u003e\u003ch2\u003eW3cProvenanceActivityType\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis value set includes W3C PROV Data Model Activity concepts, which are treated as codes in this valueset.
