         * Description: The reason or rationale for a service. A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action.  As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication.  Child concepts may be used to describe types of indication.

                        An Act may have multiple subject acts.

                        Rationale

                        The ActRelationshipType "has subject" is similar to the ParticipationType "subject", Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.

         * Description:Indicates that the target Act represents the result of the source observation Act.

                        
                           FormalConstraint: Source Act must be an Observation or specialization there-of. Source Act must not have the value attribute specified

                        
                           UsageNote: This relationship allows the result of an observation to be fully expressed as RIM acts as opposed to being embedded in the value attribute.  For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.

                        The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of "negated finding" when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.

                        
                           OpenIssue: The implications of negationInd on ActRelationship and the valueNegationind on Observation.
