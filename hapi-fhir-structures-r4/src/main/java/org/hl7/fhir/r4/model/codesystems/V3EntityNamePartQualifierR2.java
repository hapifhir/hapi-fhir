                           Usage Notes: In general, the english "middle name" concept is all of the given names after the first. This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of "mellomnavn","mellannamn". Note that there are specific rules that indicate what names may be taken as a mellannamn in different Scandinavian countries.

They are used as patterns against which input name strings may be matched for automatic identification of products from input text reports.   While they cover the concepts held under "doseForm" or "route" or "strength" the name parts are not the same and do not fit into a controlled vocabulary in the same way. By specifying up to 8 name parts a much larger range of possible names can be generated.
