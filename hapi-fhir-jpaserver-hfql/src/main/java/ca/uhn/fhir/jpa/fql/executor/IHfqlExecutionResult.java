/**
 * This interface represents a ResultSet returned by the HFQL query layer in
 * {@link IHfqlExecutor}. Think of it as roughly equivalent to the JDBC
 * {@link java.sql.ResultSet} except that it's the internal version of that.
 * <p>
 * There are several implementations of this interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *    {@link LocalSearchHfqlExecutionResult} - Implementation backed by a database search.
 *    This is used inside the HAPI FHIR server that is handling HFQL queries.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *    {@link StaticHfqlExecutionResult} - Static implementation with fixed results. This is
 *    usually used to represent errors and failed queries inside the HAPI FHIR server.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *    {@link ca.uhn.fhir.jpa.fql.jdbc.RemoteHfqlExecutionResult} - This is used inside the
 *    JDBC driver (ie. remote from the HAPI FHIR server) and holds results that have
 *    been received over the wire.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
