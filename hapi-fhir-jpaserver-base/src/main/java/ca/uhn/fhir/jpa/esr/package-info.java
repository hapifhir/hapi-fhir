/**
 * This package stores the mechanism for Externally Stored Resources (ESRs).
 * <p>
 * A normal resource stores its contents in the {@link ca.uhn.fhir.jpa.model.entity.ResourceHistoryTable}
 * entity as text (compressed JSON or otherwise) with one row in that table per version of the
 * resource. An ESR still creates a row in that table, but stores a reference to actual body
 * storage instead.
 * <p>
 * THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL API - IT MAY GO AWAY OR CHANGE IN THE FUTURE
 *
