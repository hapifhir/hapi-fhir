At the September 2015 Clinical LOINC Committee meeting, the Committee decided to change {Author Type} to {Role} to align with the 'Role' axis name in the LOINC Document Ontology.; Because it is too difficult to maintain and because the distinction between documents and sections is not clear-cut nor necessary in most cases, the DOCUMENT_SECTION field has been deemed to have little value. The field has been set to null in the December 2017 release in preparation for removal in the December 2018 release.
