At the September 2015 Clinical LOINC Committee meeting, the Committee decided to change {Author Type} to {Role} to align with the 'Role' axis name in the LOINC Document Ontology.; Because it is too difficult to maintain and because the distinction between documents and sections is not clear-cut nor necessary in most cases, the DOCUMENT_SECTION field has been deemed to have little value. The field has been set to null in the December 2017 release in preparation for removal in the December 2018 release. These changes were approved by the Clinical LOINC Committee.",0                 ,0                  ,0                    ,"IG exists"               ,                         ,           ,                 ,"81222-2;72231-4;81243-8","1.0j-a"              ,"Y"
