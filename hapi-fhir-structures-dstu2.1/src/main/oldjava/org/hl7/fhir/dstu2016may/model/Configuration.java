/**
 * This class is created to help implementers deal with a change to 
 * the API that was made between versions 0.81 and 0.9
 * 
 *  The change is the behaviour of the .getX() where the cardinality of 
 *  x is 0..1 or 1..1. Before the change, these routines would return 
 *  null if the object had not previously been assigned, and after the '
 *  change, they will automatically create the object if it had not 
 *  been assigned (unless the object is polymorphic, in which case, 
 *  only the type specific getters create the object)
 *  
 *  When making the transition from the old style to the new style, 
 *  the main change is that when testing for presence or abssense
 *  of the element, instead of doing one of these two: 
 *  
 *    if (obj.getProperty() == null)
 *    if (obj.getProperty() != null)
 *    
 *  you instead do 
 *  
 *    if (!obj.hasProperty())
 *    if (obj.hasProperty())
 *    
 * or else one of these two:
 *    
 *    if (obj.getProperty().isEmpty())
 *    if (!obj.getProperty().isEmpty())
 * 
 * The only way to sort this out is by finding all these things 
 * in the code, and changing them. 
 * 
 * To help with that, you can set the status field of this class
 * to change how this API behaves. Note: the status value is tied
 * to the way that you program. The intent of this class is to 
 * help make developers the transiition to status = 0. The old
 * behaviour is status = 2. To make the transition, set the 
 * status code to 1. This way, any time a .getX routine needs
 * to automatically create an object, an exception will be 
 * raised instead. The expected use of this is:
 *   - set status = 1
 *   - test your code (all paths) 
 *   - when an exception happens, change the code to use .hasX() or .isEmpty()
 *   - when all execution paths don't raise an exception, set status = 0
 *   - start programming to the new style. 
 * 
 * You can set status = 2 and leave it like that, but this is not 
 * compatible with the utilities and validation code, nor with the
 * HAPI code. So everyone shoul make this transition
 *  
 * This is a difficult change to make to an API. Most users should engage with it
 * as they migrate from DSTU1 to DSTU2, at the same time as they encounter 
 * other changes. This change was made in order to align the two java reference 
 * implementations on a common object model, which is an important outcome that
 * justifies making this change to implementers (sorry for any pain caused)
