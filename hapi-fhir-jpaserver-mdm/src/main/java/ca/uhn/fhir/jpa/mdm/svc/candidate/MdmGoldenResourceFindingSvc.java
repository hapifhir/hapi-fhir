	 * 3. If none are found, attempt to find Golden Resources similar to our incoming resource based on the MDM rules and field matchers.
	 * 4. If none are found, attempt to find Golden Resources that are linked to sources that are similar to our incoming resource based on the MDM rules and
	 * field matchers.
