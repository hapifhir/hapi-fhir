	 *  Date time - all the field value from the oldest or the newest recrod - e.g. use the most recent phone number
	 *  </li>
	 *  <li>
	 *  Frequency - use the most or least frequent number of occurrence - e.g. most common phone number
	 *  </li>
	 *  <li>
	 *  Integer - number functions (largest, sum, avg) - e.g. number of patient encounters

	 *  Quality of data - best quality data - e.g. data coming from a certain system is considered trusted and overrides
	 *  all other values
