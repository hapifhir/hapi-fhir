  Note: the schemas &amp; schematrons do not contain all of the rules about what makes resources
  valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and with
  any profiles that apply to the resources in order to make a conformant implementation.

This is an arbitrary value managed by the library author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.</xs:documentation>
