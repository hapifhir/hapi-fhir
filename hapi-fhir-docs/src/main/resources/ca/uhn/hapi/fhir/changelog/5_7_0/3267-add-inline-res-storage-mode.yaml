title: "A new JPA setting has been added to DaoConfig settings called **Inline Resource Text Below Size**. When
   this setting is set to a positive value, any resources with a total serialized length smaller than the given
   number will be stored as an inline VARCHAR2 text value on the HFJ_RES_VER table, instead of using an external
   LOB column. This improves read/write performance (often by a significant amount) at the expense of a slightly larger
   amount of disk usage."
