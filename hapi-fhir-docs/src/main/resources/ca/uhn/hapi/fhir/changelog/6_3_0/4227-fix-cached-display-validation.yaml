title: "When validating terminology as a part of resource validation or by directly calling the $validate-code 
   operations, an incorrect caching routine sometimes caused incorrect cached results to be returned in cases
   where display names are being validated and multiple display names were validated for the same
   system+code combination. This has been corrected."
