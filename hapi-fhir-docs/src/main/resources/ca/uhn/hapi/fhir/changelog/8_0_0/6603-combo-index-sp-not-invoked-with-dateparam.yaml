type: fix
issue: 6603
jira: SMILE-8048
title: "Previously, searches where processing was optimised with a combo index search parameters would skip searching 
the optimised indexes if a date query string was prefixed with 'eq'. Since date=2025-01-01 and date=eq2025-01-01 are 
equivalent search queries, we have harmonized the search behavior allowing optimised indexes inspection when the prefix
is present. This issue is fixed."
