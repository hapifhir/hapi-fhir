title: "A new configuration option has been added to `SubsciptionSubmitterConfig` which
  causes Subscription resources to be submitted to the processing queue synchronously
  instead of asynchronously as all other resources are. This is useful for cases where
  subscriptions need to be activated quickly. Thanks to Michal Sevcik for the contribution!"
