title: "The HapiTransactionService (HAPI FHIR JPA Transaction Manager) has been improved
   and used in a number of new places (replacing the @Transactional annotation). This
   means that stack traces have much less transaction logic noise, and give a clear
   indication of transaction boundaries."
