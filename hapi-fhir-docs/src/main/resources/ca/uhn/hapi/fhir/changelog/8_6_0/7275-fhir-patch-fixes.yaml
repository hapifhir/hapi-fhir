type: fix
issue: 7275
title: "A number of new test cases and fixes have been added to the HAPI FHIR FHIRPath Patch engine:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Replace and Delete operations containing FHIRPath expressions where the final element was
      a filter (such as <code>Observation.code.coding.where(system='http://loinc.org')</code>)
      would fail if the system URL contained a dot character.
    </li>
    <li>
      Insert operations can now add an extension to an anonymous element, as shown in the
      FHIR specification
      <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/fhirpatch.html#extension\">Extension Example</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>"
