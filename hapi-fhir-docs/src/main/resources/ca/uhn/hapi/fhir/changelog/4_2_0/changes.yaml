    issue: "1583"
    type: "fix"
    title: "As of FHIR R4, some fields that were previously of type reference are now of type canonical. One example is QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire. Technically this means that this field should no longer contain a relative reference, but as they are sometimes used that way, HAPI FHIR will now try to be permissive and will index relative link canonical fields such as (Questionnaire/123) as though it actually was a local relative link. Thanks to Dean Atchley for reporting and providing a test case!"

    title: "When parsing Bundle resources containing other resources, XML/JSON parsers have an option called \"override resource ID with bundle entry fullUrl\". This option previously caused any value found in Bundle.entry.fullUrl to override any value found in Bundle.entry.resource.id (meaning that the parsed resource would take its ID from the fullUrl even if that ID disagreed with the ID found in the resource itself. As of HAPI FHIR 4.1.0 the value in Bundle.entry.fullUrl will only be used to set the parsed resource ID if the resource has no ID present."
