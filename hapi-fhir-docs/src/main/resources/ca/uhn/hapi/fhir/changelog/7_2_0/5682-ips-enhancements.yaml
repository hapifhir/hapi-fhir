title: "Several enhancements have been made to the International Patient Summary generator based on
  feedback from implementers:
  <ul>
  <li>
     New methods have been added to the <code>IIpsGenerationStrategy</code> allowing resources
     for any or all sections to be fetched from a source other than the FHIR repository.
  </li>
  <li>
     The <code>IpsSectionEnum</code> class has been removed and replaced in any user-facing APIs
     with references to <code>SectionRegistry.Section</code>. This makes it much easier to
     extend or replace the section registry with custom sections not defined in the universal
     IPS implementation guide.  
  </li>
  <li>
     Captions have been removed from narrative section tables, and replaced with H5 tags
     directly above the table. This results in an easier to read display since the table
     title will appear above the table instead of below it. 
  </li>
  <li>
     The IPS narrative generator built in templates will now omit tables when the template
     specified multiple tables and the specific table would have no resources.
  </li>
  </ul>"
