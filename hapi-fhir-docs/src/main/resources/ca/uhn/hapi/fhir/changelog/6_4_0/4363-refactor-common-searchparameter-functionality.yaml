title: "Common `SearchParameter` functionality has been refactored. In particular, 
1) Validation logic performed inside `JpaResourceDaoSearchParameter` has been moved into a new class called 
`SearchParameterDaoValidator` 2) Logic for extracting combo unique and combo non-unique search parameters 
that was inside `SearchParamWithInlineReferencesExtractor` has been moved into `BaseSearchParamExtractor`
and 3) a new interface called `IResourceIndexComboSearchParameter` has been added which provides a common interface 
for combo unique and combo non-unique search parameters."
