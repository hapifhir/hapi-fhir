title: "The error messages returned in an OperationOutcome when validating terminology codes
  as a part of resource profile validation have been improved. Machine processable location
  (line/col) information is now available through a pair of dedicated extensions, and
  error messages such as UCUM parsing issues are now returned to the client (previously
  they were swallowed and a generic error message was returned)."
