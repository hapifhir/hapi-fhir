title: "A new FHIR client implementation based on Apache HttpClient 5.x has been
  added to HAPI FHIR. This implementation is optional for now, with the default
  remaining to use HttpClient 4.x, but this will likely become the default (and only
  supported version of the HttpClient library) in the future. Thanks to 
  Ibrahim Tallouzi for the contribution!"
