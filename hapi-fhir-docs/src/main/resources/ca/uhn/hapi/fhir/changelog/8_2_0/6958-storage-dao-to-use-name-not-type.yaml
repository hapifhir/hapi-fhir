issue: 6958
title: "When attempting to patch a resource in a partitioned system
        with a registered `STORAGE_PARTITION_SELECTED` interceptor,
        an error would result because of the use of getTypeName of a class
        instead of getSimpleName (the former returning package info, the latter
        just the class name).
        This has now been fixed.
"
