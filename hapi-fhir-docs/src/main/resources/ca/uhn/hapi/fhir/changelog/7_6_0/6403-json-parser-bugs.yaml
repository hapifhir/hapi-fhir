title: "Fixed a rare bug in the JSON Parser, wherein client-assigned contained resource IDs could collide with server-assigned contained IDs. For example if a 
resource had a client-assigned contained ID of `#2`, and a contained resource with no ID, then depending on the processing order, the parser could occasionally 
provide duplicate contained resource IDs, leading to non-deterministic behaviour."
