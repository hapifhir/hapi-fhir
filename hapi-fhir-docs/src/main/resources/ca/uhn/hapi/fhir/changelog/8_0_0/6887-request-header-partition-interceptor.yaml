title: "A new partition interceptor that can be used to identify partitions based on a specific 
request header called `X-Request-Partition-IDs` has been added. The header value is expected to be a comma-separated 
list of partition ids. Also, a mechanism was introduced for overriding this header in a transaction bundle for 
individual request entries if needed. This allows writing different transaction entries to different partitions 
in the same transaction."
