title: "The R5 structure methods for working with extensions on arbtrary fields, e.g.
   `getExtensionByUrl(String)`, `removeExtension(String)`, `getExtensionsByUrl(String)`
   `hasExtension(String)`, and `getExtensionString(String)` have been enhanced so that they
   now return modifier extensions as well as the non-modifier extensions they previously
   returned."
