title: "An prototype interface to abstract data access across different types
 of FHIR repositories (e.g. remote REST, local JPA) has been added to the `hapi-fhir-base` project.
  Implementations of this interface will follow in future HAPI releases, and it will continue to evolve
  as it's validated through implementation."
