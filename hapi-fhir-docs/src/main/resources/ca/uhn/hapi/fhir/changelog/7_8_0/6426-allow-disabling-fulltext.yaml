title: "Previously, it was not possible to enable Hibernate Search but not use it
  for fulltext indexing. This meant that you could not enable HS-based terminology
  services without also enabling fulltext indexing of all resources. A new setting
  has been added to the JpaStorageSettings bean 
  called `HibernateSearchIndexFullText` which controls whether HS will be used for
  fulltext indexing. The existing property `AdvancedHSearchIndexing` has also been
  deprecated and a new equivalent (but better named) property
  called `HibernateSearchIndexSearchParams`."
