title: "An XSS vulnerability was reported in the HAPI FHIR Testpage Overlay module. Thanks to Will Davison of NCC Group (Manchester UK) for disclosing this vulnerability.

 Users of the HAPI FHIR Testpage Overlay can use a specially crafted URL to exploit an XSS vulnerability in this module, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the user's browser. The impact of this vulnerability is believed to be low, as this module is intended for testing and not believed to be widely used for any production purposes. Nonetheless, we recommend all users of the affected module upgrade immediately.

 A complete audit of the affected codebase has been completed in order to detect and resolve any similar issues."
