title: "Previously, it was possible for a resource to change versions during a no-op update, due to a bug in tag selection. If a resource had tags, and was updated with no change, it was possible 
for the history version to be changed (e.g. from `Patient/1/_history/1` to `Patient/1/_history/2`) due to a bug in tag uniqueness detection. This has been fixed"
