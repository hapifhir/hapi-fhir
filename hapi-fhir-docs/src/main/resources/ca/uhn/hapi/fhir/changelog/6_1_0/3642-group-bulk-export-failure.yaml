type: fix
issue: 3642
backport: 6.0.1
jira: SMILE-4383
title: "Previously, the RuleBuilder's rules surrounding Group Bulk Export would return failures too early in the case of multiple permissions. This has been corrected, and the rule will no longer prematurely
return a DENY verdict, instead opting to delegate to future rules."
