title: "CDS Hooks now requires the `fhirServer` field to use HTTPS in requests when using 
[CDS Hooks version 2.0](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/2.0/), as per 
the specification. The CDS Hooks version can be configured by providing a bean that returns a `CDSHooksVersion` enum value, 
introduced in this update. By default, the version is set to 1.1 to maintain compatibility with existing 
implementations."
