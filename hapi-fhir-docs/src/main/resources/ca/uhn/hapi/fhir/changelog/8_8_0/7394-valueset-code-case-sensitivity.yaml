backport: 8.4.2
title: "A new setting JpaStorageSettings.setAllowDatabaseValidationOverride(boolean) has been added.
  When enabled, database-stored CodeSystem and ValueSet resources take precedence over built-in
  default profile validation resources. This allows user-defined terminology resources to override
  built-in HL7 definitions when performing validation operations."
