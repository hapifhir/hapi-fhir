title: "The API for merging FHIR resources has moved from `TerserUtil` to `ResourceUtil`. The API has been
updated to allow optional lenient matching and merging of `CodeableConcept` fields. These lenient matching
options include insensitivity to the order of the `Coding`s; allowing a match where one list of `Coding`s
is a subset of the other; and allowing a match where two `Coding`s have the same system and code,
but differ in other detail fields."
