title: "Extended the existing MDM similarity algorithms to numeric values such that the input is normalized 
by removing all non-numeric characters from the string before the similarity algorithm is applied. This can 
be useful when wanting to measure similarity between identifying numbers or phone numbers where dashes or 
other special separating characters may be used."
