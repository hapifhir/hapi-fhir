title: "The in-memory search matcher module (used for Subscriptions and other
  places where a resource needs to be evaluated against an existing pool of
  search parameter expressions) has been optimized so that it doesn't evaluate
  unnecessary search parameters while analyzing the resource. Thanks to
  Ahmet Melih AydoÄŸdu for the pull request!"
