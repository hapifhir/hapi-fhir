title: "Batch2 jobs with reduction steps didn't fire the completion handler.
        This has been fixed.
        There is now also an `AdditionalData` object that will be passed into
        reduction jobs (created in the reduction step worker) that will allow
        data to be collected / cached across all reduction consumption steps
        without the need of local variables that need to be reset after reduction
        step completion (a bug prone approach currently in place).
