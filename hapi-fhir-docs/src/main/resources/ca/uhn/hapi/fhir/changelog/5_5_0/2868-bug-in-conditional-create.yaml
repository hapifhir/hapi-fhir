jira: SMILE-1153
title: "Fixed a bug in transaction bundle processing, specifically for bundles which contained both a conditional create, and a resource which relied on this conditional create as a reference.
This would cause the referring resource to generate a contained resource instead of appropriately referencing the existing patient."
