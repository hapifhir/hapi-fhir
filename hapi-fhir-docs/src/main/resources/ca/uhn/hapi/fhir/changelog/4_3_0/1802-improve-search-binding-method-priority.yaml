issue: 1802
title: "In a plain server, if a Resource Provider class had two methods with the same parameter names
  (as specified in the @OptionalParam or @RequiredParam) but different cardinalities, the server could
  sometimes pick the incorrect method to execute. The selection algorithm has been improved to no longer
  have this issue."
