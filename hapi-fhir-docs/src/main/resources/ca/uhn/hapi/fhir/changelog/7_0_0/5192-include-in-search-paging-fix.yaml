title: "Fixed a bug where search Bundles with `include` entries from an _include query parameter might
      trigger a 'next' link to blank pages.
      Specifically, if _include'd resources + requested resources were greater than (or equal to)
      requested page size, a 'next' link would be generated, even though no additional
      resources are available.
