title: "Added a new pointcut: STORAGE_PRE_INITIATE_BULK_EXPORT.
        This pointcut is meant to be called explicitly before
        STORAGE_INITIATE_BULK_EXPORT, so that parameter
        manipulation that needs to be done before permission
        checks (currently done using STORAGE_INITIATE_BULK_EXPORT)
        can safely be done without risk of affecting permission checks/
        authorization.
"
