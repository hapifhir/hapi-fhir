type: fix
issue: 7415
title: "When processing a JPA server search query containing a simple
   date parameter (e.g. `Patient?birthdate=2020-01-01`) the server incorrectly
   converted this into a date range with an identical lower and upper bound.
   This did not affect the correctness of results returned, but did cause an
   error when performing this search with Java assertions enabled. This has been
   corrected."
