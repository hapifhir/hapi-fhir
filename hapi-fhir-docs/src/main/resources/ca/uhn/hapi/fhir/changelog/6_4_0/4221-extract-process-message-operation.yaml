title: "The JPA server implementation of the $process-message operation has been extracted into
   a standalone provider called `ProcessMessageProvider` which can be registered individually
   on servers that have provided an implementation of the backing operation. Because this operation
   can not be implemented in a generic was in HAPI FHIR (it assumes business-specific processing
   logic) it does not make sense to include it by default."
