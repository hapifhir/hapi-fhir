title: "Added a map of `additionalData` to BulkExport job params.
        This will allow consumers of BulkExport to add additional
        data to be accessed at later steps by using various pointcuts
        in the system.
        Updated ConsentService so that BulkExport operations will
        call the willSeeResource method for each exported resource.
