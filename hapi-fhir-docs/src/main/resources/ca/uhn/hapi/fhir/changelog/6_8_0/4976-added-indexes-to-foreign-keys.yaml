type: fix
issue: 4976
title: "Added a test to verify that all Foreign Key constraints are explicitly
      indexed as well.
      Added indexes to a number of tables that declared foreign keys
      that weren't explicitly indexed.
      This should not only make many of these queries (including $mdm-clear operations)
      much faster, it will prevent deadlocks in Oracle and other databases that require
      foreign keys to be indexed.
"
