title: "A new _expunge parameter has been added to the DELETE operation when deleting multiple resources via a URL.  For
example DELETE http://www.example.com:8000/Observation?_expunge=true or
DELETE http://www.example.com:8000/Observation?status=cancelled&_expunge=true.  When the _expunge parameter is provided to DELETE
then the matched resources and all of their history will be both deleted and expunged from the database.  This will
perform considerably faster than doing the delete and expunge separately.  Note that Expunge must be enabled on the
server for this to work."
