type: fix
issue: 6111
title: "Previously, the package installer wouldn't create a composite SearchParameter resource if the SearchParameter 
resource didn't have an expression element at the root level. This has now been fixed by making
SearchParameter validation in package installer consistent with the DAO level validations."
