type: fix
issue: 5667
title: "Previously, creating an XML encoded FHIR resource with a decimal element that has a leading plus sign value 
would result in `JsonParseException` during the read operation from the database. Thus, making it impossible to 
retrieve or modify such resources. This has been fixed."
