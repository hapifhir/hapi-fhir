type: fix
issue: 2043
title: "The JPA SearchParameetr validator did not reject custom Search Parameetrs with an invalid path
   expression consisting of only a resource type and no element name. Creating such a search parameter could cause
   strange indexing issues, so this has been added to the validator."
