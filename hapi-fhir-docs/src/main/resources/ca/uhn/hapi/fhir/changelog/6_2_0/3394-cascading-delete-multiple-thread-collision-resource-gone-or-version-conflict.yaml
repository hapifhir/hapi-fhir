title: "Cascading deletes don't work correctly if multiple threads initiate a delete at the same time.  Either the resource won't be found or there will be a collision on inserting the new version.  This changes fixes the problem by better handling these conditions to either ignore an already deleted resource or to keep retrying in a new inner transaction.."
