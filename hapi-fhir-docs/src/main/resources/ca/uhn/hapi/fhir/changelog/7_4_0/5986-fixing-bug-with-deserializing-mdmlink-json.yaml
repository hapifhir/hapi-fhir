issue: 5985
title: "Fixed an issue where MDM json links were unserializable
        due to using the IResourcePersistenceId objects.
        This has been fixed and IResourcePersistenceId objects
        should now be serializable/deserializable; although not
        into the exact object they were before (this is a general
        solution, not a specific one for all types of
        IResourcePersistenceId objects..
