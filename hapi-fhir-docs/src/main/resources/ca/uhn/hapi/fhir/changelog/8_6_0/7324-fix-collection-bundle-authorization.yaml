type: fix
issue: 7324
title: "Previously, the AuthorizationInterceptor did not properly authorize searches and reads
   for COLLECTION type Bundles when users had appropriate permissions. This has been fixed by
   adding BundleTypeEnum.COLLECTION to the set of standalone bundle resource types that are
   treated similarly to DOCUMENT and MESSAGE bundles for authorization purposes."
