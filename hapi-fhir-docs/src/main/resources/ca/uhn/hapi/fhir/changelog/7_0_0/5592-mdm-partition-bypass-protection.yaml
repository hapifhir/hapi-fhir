type: fix
title: "$everything queries with MDM expansion were bypassing the partition boundary by return resources outside the partition.
        Also, POST (as opposed to GET) $everything queries with MDM expansion.
        The first issue was fixed by reversing the previous changes and by filtering source and golden resources
        by partition ID.
        The second issue was fixed by correctly capturing the MDM expansion flag in POST $everything queries."
