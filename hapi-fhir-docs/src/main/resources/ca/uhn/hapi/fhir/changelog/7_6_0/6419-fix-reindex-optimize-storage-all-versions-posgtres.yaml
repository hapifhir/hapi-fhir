type: fix
issue: 6419
title: "Previously, on Postgres, the `$reindex` operation with `optimizeStorage` set to `ALL_VERSIONS` would process 
only a subset of versions if there were more than 100 versions to be processed for a resource. This has been fixed 
so that all versions of the resource are now processed."
