title: "A new tag storage mode called **Inline Tag Mode** tas been added. In this mode, all tags are stored directly
  in the serialized resource body in the database, instead of using dedicated tables. This has significant performance
  advantages when storing resources with many distinct tags (i.e. many tags that are unique to each resource, as opposed
  to being reused across multiple resources)."
