title: "Introduce IBaseResource.isDeleted() method and convert code to use it.
Add subscription_topic_troubleshooting log.
No longer rely on ResourceGoneException to detect deleted subscription. Instead use the new isDeleted() method.
Demote unexpected exceptions in HapiTransactionService from error to debug since these exceptions are expected
e.g. when checking if a resource has been deleted by catching a ResourceGoneException"
