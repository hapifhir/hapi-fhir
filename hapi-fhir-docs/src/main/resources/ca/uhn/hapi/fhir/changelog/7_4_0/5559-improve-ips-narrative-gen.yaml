issue: 5559
title: "The IPS narrative generator previously created narratives for each `Composition.section.text` entry, 
   but also combined these section narratives into a single concatenated narrative for `Composition.text`. This
   caused validation issues as the narratives then contained duplicate IDs, and also wasted space. This has
   been removed."
