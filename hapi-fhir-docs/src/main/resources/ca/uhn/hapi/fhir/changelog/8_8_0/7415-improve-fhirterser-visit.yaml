type: fix
issue: 7415
backport: 8.6.1
title: "The `FhirTerser.visit(IBase, IModelVisitor2)` method had inconsistent
  handling of extensions between DSTU2 structures and DSTU3+ structures. The
  `IModelVisitor2.acceptUndeclaredExtension` method has been deprecated
  (since it is only invoked for DSTU2 structures) and the
  `IModelVisitor2.accept` method is now always called for extensions. Previously  the latter was called for extensions on composite elements but not for
  extensions on primitive elements."
