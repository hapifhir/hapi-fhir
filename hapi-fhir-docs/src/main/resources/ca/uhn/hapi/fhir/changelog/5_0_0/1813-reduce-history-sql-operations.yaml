title: History operations in the JPA server have been significantly optimized to remove the number of SQL SELECT statements,
   and to completely eliminate any INSERT statements. This should have a positive effect on heavy users of history
   operations. In addition, history operations will no longer write an entry in the query cache (HFJ_SEARCH) table which
   should further improve performance of this operation.
