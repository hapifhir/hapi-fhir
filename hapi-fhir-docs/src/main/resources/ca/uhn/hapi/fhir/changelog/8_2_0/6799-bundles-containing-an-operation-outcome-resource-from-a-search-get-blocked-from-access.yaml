issue: 6799
title: "Fixed an issue where bundles containing an operation outcome from a search could not be accessed without explicit
 read permissions given for the OperationOutcome resource. Now, if an OperationOutcome is returned as part of an otherwise authorized search or page query, the OperationOutcomes 
 are implicitly permitted to be returned."
