title: "Fix incorrect behaviour of `ParameterUtil.unescape(String)`.
  The function would 'eat' multiple consecutive occurrences of backslash.
  Adding a test class to cover `ParameterUtil.unescape()` and `ParameterUtil.escape()`.  Perviously it would have been 
  impossible to search for an identifier with a value containing two consecutive backslashes such as: `abc\\\\def`. 
  This search requires the following search parameter `identifier=abcd\\\\\\\\def`.  
  The two consecutive escaped occurrences of `\\` would have previously been inadvertently unescaped to just one occurrence.
