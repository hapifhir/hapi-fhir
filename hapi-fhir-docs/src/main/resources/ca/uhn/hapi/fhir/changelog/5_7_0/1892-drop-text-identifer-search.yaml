title: "In the JPA server, searching using the token `:text` modifier will no longer index and match
  values in `Identifier.type.text`. Previously we indexed this element, but the FHIR specification does not
  actually show this field as being indexed for this modifier, and intuitively it doesn't make sense to
  do so."
