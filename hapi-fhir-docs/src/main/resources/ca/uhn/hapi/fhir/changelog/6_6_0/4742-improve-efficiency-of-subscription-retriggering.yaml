title: "The SQL generated for the JPA server `$trigger-subscription` operation has been 
   optimized in order to drastically reduce the number of database round trips for large
   triggering jobs. In addition, a bug prevented the subscription retriggering from fully 
   executing in a multithreaded way. This has been corrected."
