title: "There is inconsistent validation in the case of an incorrect communications language coding due to validation that looks for the first correct Coding.
        In the case of a single incorrect code there is one validation result.
        In the case of one correct code and one incorrect code, there is an entirely different result.
        This has been fixed by introducing a new boolean flag in CachingValidationSupport as well as a new constructor to leverage it."
