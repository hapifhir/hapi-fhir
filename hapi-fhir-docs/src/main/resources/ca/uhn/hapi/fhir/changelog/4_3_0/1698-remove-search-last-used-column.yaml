title: "Removed the SEARCH_LAST_RETURNED column of the HFJ_SEARCH table.  HAPI FHIR updated the HFJ_SEARCH table with every
request, but this led to unecessary database load.  The purpose of this column was to ensure that search results were
kept around long enough for systems that needed them for paging (default one hour).  When expiring search results,
we used to add one hour to SEARCH_LAST_RETURNED to determine the expiry time.  However, the length of time where a search
result could be updated was relatively small (default one minute).  So rather than keeping track of the expiry time to expire
exactly one hour after the last returned time, hapi now simply expires after the maximum possible length of time (default one hour
plus one minute).  This eliminates the need to update the HFJ_SEARCH table with every search."
