issue: 7406
backport: 8.6.2
title: "A new parameter has been added to the `$hapi.fhir.bulk-patch` and
   `$hapi.fhir.bulk-patch-rewrite-history` operations which can be used to
   explicitly specify the partition(s) to use when applying these
   operations. This change also generally improves support for using these
   jobs in a partitioned environment."
