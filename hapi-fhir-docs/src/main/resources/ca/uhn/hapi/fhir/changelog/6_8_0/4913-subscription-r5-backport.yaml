title: "Added support for Topic Subscription Filters.  In R4B and R5, SubscriptionTopic notifications
will interpret subscription filters as FHIR Search Parameters and perform an in-memory match of the focus resource
against the search parameters.  For R4 or user-generated event notifications, the caller can specify a custom
implementation of ISubscriptionTopicFilterMatcher on the call to SubscriptionTopicDispatcher.dispatch() to provide
custom filter matching logic."
