title: "When performing a FHIR Transaction which deletes and then updates (or otherwise
   un-deletes) the same resource within a single transaction, the delete was previously
   not stored as a distinct version (meaning that the resource version was only
   incremented once, and no delete was actually stored in the resource history. This
   has been changed so that deletes will always appear as a distinct entry in the
   resource history."
