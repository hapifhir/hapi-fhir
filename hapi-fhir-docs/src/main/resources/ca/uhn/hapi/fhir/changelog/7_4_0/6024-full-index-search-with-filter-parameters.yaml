title: "Fixed a bug in search where requesting a count with HSearch indexing
        and FilterParameter enabled and using the _filter parameter would result
        in inaccurate results being returned.
        This happened because the count query would use an incorrect set of parameters
        to find the count, and the regular search when then try and ensure its results
        matched the count query (which it couldn't because it had different parameters).
