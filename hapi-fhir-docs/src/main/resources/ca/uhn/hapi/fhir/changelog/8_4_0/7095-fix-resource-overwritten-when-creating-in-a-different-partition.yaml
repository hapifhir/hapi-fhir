type: fix
issue: 7095
title: "When database partition mode was enabled and the cross-partition reference mode was set to ALLOWED_UNQUALIFIED, 
creating a resource with a forced ID that already existed for the same resource type in a different partition would 
overwrite the existing resource. This issue has now been fixed."
