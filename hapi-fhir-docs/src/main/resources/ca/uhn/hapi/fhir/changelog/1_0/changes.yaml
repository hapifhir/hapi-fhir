    issue: "113"
    type: "fix"
    title: "When a user manually creates the list of contained resources in a resource, the encoder fails to encode any resources that don't have a '#' at the start of their ID. This is unintuitive, so we now assume that '123' means '#123'. Thanks to myungchoi for reporting and providing a test case!"

- item:
    issue: "124"
    type: "add"
    title: "When encoding resources, the parser will now convert any resource references to versionless references automatically (i.e. it will omit the version part automatically if one is present in the reference) since references between resources must be versionless. Additionally, references in server responses will omit the server base URL part of the reference if the base matches the base for the server giving the response."

    title: "Narrative generator incorrectly sets the Resource.text.status to 'generated' even if the given resource type does not have a template (and therefore no narrative is actually generated). Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for reporting!"

    type: "add"
    title: "Add new server address strategy \"ApacheProxyAddressStrategy\" which uses headers \"x-forwarded-host\" and \"x-forwarded-proto\" to determine the server's address. This is useful if you are deploying a HAPI FHIR server behind an Apache proxy (e.g. for load balancing or other reasons). Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for contributing!"
