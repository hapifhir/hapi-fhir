title: "Updated the Reindex Batch2 job to allow
        for an additional step that will check to ensure
        that no pending 'reindex' work is needed.
        This was done to prevent a bug in which
        value set expansion would not return all
        the existing CodeSystem Concepts after
        a reindex call, due to some of the concepts
        being deferred to future job runs.
        
        As such, `$reindex` operations on CodeSystems
        will no longer result in incorrect value set
        expansion when such an expansion is called
        'too soon' after a $reindex operation.
