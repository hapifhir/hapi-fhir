type: fix
issue: 7367
title: "Previously, when the Remote Terminology Service was enabled and its base URL was set to 
[https://r4.ontoserver.csiro.au/fhir/](https://r4.ontoserver.csiro.au/fhir/), sending a `$validate` request returned 
a 404 Not Found, and the OperationOutcome in the response contained error messages indicating the referenced `ValueSet` 
could not be found. This has now been fixed."
