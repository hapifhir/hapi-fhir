title: "A new MdmSettings mode field was added (default value LINK_PROCESSING). When the MdmSettings mode is set to
RULES mode, then MDM operations are disabled and no MDM processing occurs. This is useful if, for example,
you want to use the Patient/$match operation without having the overhead of creating links and golden resources."
