title: "Add STORAGE_POSTSTORAGE_BATCH_JOB_CREATE and BATCH2_JOB_COMPLETION pointcuts in batch 2 jobs.
STORAGE_POSTSTORAGE_BATCH_JOB_CREATE is invoked after a batch job is persisted to the database and receives a
ca.uhn.fhir.batch2.model.JobInstance that includes the job instance id as stored in the db
BATCH2_JOB_COMPLETION is invoked after the job instance is completed. JobInstance is immutable here and receives a
ca.uhn.fhir.batch2.model.JobInstance"
