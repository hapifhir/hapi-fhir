type: fix
issue: 1801
title: "In previous versions of HAPI FHIR, the server incorrectly silently accepted decimal numbers in JSON with no
   leading numbers (e.g. `.123`), as well as decimal numbers with more than one leading zero (e.g. 00.123). These will 
   now be rejected by the JSON parser. Any values with this string that have previously been stored in the JPA server 
   database will now automatically normalize the value to `0.123`."
