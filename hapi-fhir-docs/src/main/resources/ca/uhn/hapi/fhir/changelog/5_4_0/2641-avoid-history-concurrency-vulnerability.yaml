issue: 2641
title: "A vulnerability in the FHIR History operation was resolved. When running HAPI FHIR JPA server on a large database (i.e. containing
   a large number of resources), if a malicious user performs a large number of concurrent FHIR History (`_history`) operations,
   an expensive `COUNT()` statement can consume all available database resources and ultimately trigger resource exhaustion and
   disable the server. A huge thanks to **Zachary Minneker at Security Innovation** who discovered and submitted a responsible disclosure of this issue."
