jira: SMILE-11072, SMILE-11142
title: "Previously, when a Bulk Export job was created, querying the polling location immediately after a successful
delete request returned a 202 status instead of the expected 404. This has been fixed to return a 404 status and
an `OperationOutcome` indicating that the job was cancelled to conform to the FHIR Bulk Data specification."
