title: When performing large terminology concept additions via the delta addition service, concepts will
  now be added via the deferred storage service, meaning that they will be added in small incremental batches
  instead of as a part of one large transaction. This helps to avoid timeouts and memory issues when uploading
  large collections of concepts.
