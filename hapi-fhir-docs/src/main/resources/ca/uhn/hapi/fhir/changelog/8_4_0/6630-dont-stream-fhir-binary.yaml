type: fix
issue: 6630
title: "When reading a Binary resource from the server that contains a FHIR resource, while accepting the same FHIR 
content type, the server did stream the Binary content instead of returning the Binary itself, contrary to the FHIR 
specification. This is fixed now. Thanks to Quentin Ligier for the pull request!"
