type: fix
issue: 6818
title: "When performing a conditional create/update/etc in a FHIR transaction, if the conditional
   URL had parameters with a type other than `token`, the transaction processor could fail with
   a constraint error if the target already existed. This has been corrected. Thanks to
   Brian Lind for reporting!"
