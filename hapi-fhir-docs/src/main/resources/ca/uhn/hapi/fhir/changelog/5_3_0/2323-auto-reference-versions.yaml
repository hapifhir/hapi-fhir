title: "The JPA server has a new setting on the `ModelConfig` bean called \"AutoVersionReferencesAtPaths\". Using
   this setting, the server can be configured to add the current target resource version ID to any resource 
   references found in a resource being stored. In addition, a new setting has been added to the JPA ModelConfig
   bean that allows `_include` statements to respect versioned references, and actually include the correct
   version for the reference."
