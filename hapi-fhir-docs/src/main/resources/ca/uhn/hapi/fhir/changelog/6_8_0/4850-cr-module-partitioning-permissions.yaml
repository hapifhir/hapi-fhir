type: fix
issue: 4832
title: "When deploying hapi-fhir in partitioned environment, users were being blocked from reaching required resources 
from default partition. This fix allows access to required resources (Library) for clinical reasoning operations and directs 
non-partitionable resource requests to default partition and injects SystemRequest details along with requested partition where 
required resources were being blocked (Patient, Coverage, etc)."
