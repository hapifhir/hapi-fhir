type: fix
issue: 4968
title: "Previously, when performing a `$mdm-clear` followed by an update to an existing resource without doing the required `$mdm-submit` first, a non-descriptive NullPointerException was thrown. To fix this, a more descriptive/suggestive message will be logged when this condition is detected."
