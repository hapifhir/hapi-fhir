type: fix
issue: 6208
title: "Tinder generated ResourceProvider files were pulling in a duplicate `_lastUpdated` value.
        This results in a broken signature for the providers, and a broken search.
        As a workaround, we will skip search parameters named `_lastUpdated` because
        these are already manually added to the search parameter map in jpa_resource_provider.vm.

        THIS IS ONLY TO FIX A REGRESSION FOR RELEASE!
        A REAL FIX IS FORTHCOMING IN A FUTHRE VERSION.
