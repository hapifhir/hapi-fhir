title: "A new experimental interceptor called the MdmReadVirtualizationInterceptor
  has been added. This interceptor rewrites results when querying an MDM-enabled
  JPA server in order to always include linked resources and rerwrites query results
  to link to the MDM golden resource. This interceptor is still being developed
  and should be used with caution."
