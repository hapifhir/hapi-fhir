issue: 4957
title: "Previously, with remote-terminology service enabled, for $validate-code operations, the server responded
with a HTTP 500 and NullPointerException instead of an HTTP 200 and a useful error message if an unknown CodeSystem or unknown ValueSet is provided.
This problem has been fixed."
