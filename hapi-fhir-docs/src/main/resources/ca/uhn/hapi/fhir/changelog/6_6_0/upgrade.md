This release has breaking changes.
* The Generic Client validate() method now throws an exception when validation fails.  This more closely aligns it with
  the POST $validate behaviour.  See the Validate section of the [Hapi-fhir Generic Client Documentation](https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/client/generic_client.html) for details.
