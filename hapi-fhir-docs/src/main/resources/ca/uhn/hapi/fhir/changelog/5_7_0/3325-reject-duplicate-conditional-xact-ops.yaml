title: "In HAPI FHIR 5.6.0, a regression meant that JPA server FHIR transactions containing two identical 
  conditional operations (for example, a transaction with two conditional create operations where the 
  conditional URL was identical for both) could result in resources being saved in an inconsistent state.
  This scenario will now be result in the server returning an HTTP 400 error instead. Note that there is 
  no meaning defined in the FHIR specification for duplicate entries in a FHIR transaction bundle, so it
  has never been recommended to do this."
