title: "HAPi-FHIR provides indexing on Canonical Types as references. However, the option to [treat absolute references as local](/docs/server_jpa/configuration.html#jpa-server-configuration-options)
 was being ignored for those indexed canonicals. This has been corrected. Now, if you have set `getTreatBaseUrlsAsLocal()` and HAPI-FHIR detects a canonical which starts with such a url, that prefix will be stripped,
   and indexing will occur normally."
