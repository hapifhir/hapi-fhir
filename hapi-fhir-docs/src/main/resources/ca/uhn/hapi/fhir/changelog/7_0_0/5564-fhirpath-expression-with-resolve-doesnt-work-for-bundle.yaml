type: fix
issue: 5564
title: "Previously, FHIRPath expression evaluation when using the `_fhirpath` parameter would not work on chained 
use of 'resolve()'. This was most notable when using `_fhirpath` with FHIR Documents (i.e. 'Bundle' of type 'document' 
where 'entry[0]' is a 'Composition'). This has now been fixed."
