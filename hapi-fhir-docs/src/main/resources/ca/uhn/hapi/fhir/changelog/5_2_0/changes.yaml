     title: "The JPA Server SQL generator for handling FHIR search operations has been completely rewritten to
     no longer depend on the Hibernate QueryBuilder APIs. This rewrite produces much more efficient SQL in many cases
     and should dramatically increase performance in such cases. For example, a 10x speedup has been observed on
     Postgresql when searching a very large database where the search URL has multiple chained search params.
     <br/><br/>
     This new SQL builder will be disabled by default in HAPI FHIR 5.2.0 and Smile CDR 2020.11.R01, and can be enabled
     via a setting in the DaoConfig (HAPI FHIR) and Storage Module config (Smile CDR). Snapshot/prerelease builds will
     ship with this new SQL builder enabled by default, and the intention is to make this the default and ultimately
     remove the legacy SQL builder in the next quarterly release.
     <br/><br/>
     We highly encourage testing of this new feature, and welcome feedback on how it performs in your environment.
