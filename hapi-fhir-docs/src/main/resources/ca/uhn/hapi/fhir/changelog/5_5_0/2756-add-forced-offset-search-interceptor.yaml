title: "A new interceptor has been addeed to the JPA server called `ForceOffsetSearchModeInterceptor`. This
  interceptor forces all searches to be offset searches, instead of relying on the query cache. This means
  that FHIR search operations will never result in any database write, which can be good for highly
  concurrent servers."
