type: fix
issue: 4034
title: "With Elastic/Lucene indexing enabled search including `:text` qualifier was considering tokens literally but
   standard match in HAPI-FHIR considers arguments as prefixes. This has been corrected by making Elastic/Lucene
   `:text` search also consider arguments as prefixes."
