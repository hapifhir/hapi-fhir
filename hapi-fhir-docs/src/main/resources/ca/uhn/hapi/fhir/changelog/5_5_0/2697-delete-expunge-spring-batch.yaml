issue: 2697
title: "DELETE _expunge=true has been converted to use Spring Batch.  It now simply returns the jobId of the Spring Batch
job while the job continues to run in the background.  A new operation called $expunge-delete has been added to provide
more fine-grained control of the delete expunge operation.  This operation accepts an ordered list of URLs to be delete
expunged and an optional batch-size parameter that will be used to perform the delete expunge.  If no batch size is
specified in the operation, then the value of DaoConfig.getExpungeBatchSize() is used."
