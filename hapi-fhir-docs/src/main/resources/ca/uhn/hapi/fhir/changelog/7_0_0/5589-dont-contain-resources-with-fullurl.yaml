issue: 5589
title: "When encoding a Bundle, if resources in bundle entries had a value in 
   `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` but no value in `Bundle.entry.resource.id`, the parser
   sometimes incorrectly moved these resources to be contained within other
   resources when serializing the bundle. This has been corrected."
