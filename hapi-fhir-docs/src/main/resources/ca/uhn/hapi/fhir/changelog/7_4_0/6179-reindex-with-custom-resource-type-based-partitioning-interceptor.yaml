type: fix
issue: 6179
title: "Previously, the $reindex operation would fail when using a custom partitioning interceptor which decides the partition 
based on the resource type in the request. This has been fixed, such that we avoid retrieving the resource type from 
the request, rather we use the urls provided as parameters to the operation to determine the partitions."
