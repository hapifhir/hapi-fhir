type: fix
issue: 3992
title: "Previously when ValueSets were pre-expanded after loinc terminology upload, expansion was failing with an exception for each ValueSet
   with more than 10,000 properties. This problem has been fixed.
This fix changed some freetext mappings (definitions about how resources are freetext indexed) for terminology resources, which requires
   reindexing those resources. To do this use the `reindex-terminology` command."
