type: fix
issue: 1761
title: "A minor regression in 4.2.0 was introduced, where JPA searches using the `_id` search parameter often had
   a duplicate SQL predicate in their where clause. This issue may not have caused any bad effects on some environments, 
   but it did look strange in SQL logs and has been corrected."
