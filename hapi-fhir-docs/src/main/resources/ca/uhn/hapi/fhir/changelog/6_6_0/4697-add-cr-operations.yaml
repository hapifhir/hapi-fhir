title: "Added R4 and DSTU3 (where applicable) support for the FHIR Clinical Reasoning module operations ActivityDefinition/$apply and PlanDefinition/$apply.
$apply allows for general workflow processing and is used in clinical decision support, prior authorization, reporting, and disease surveillance use cases. 

Added support for the DaVinci Structured Data Capture (SDC) operations Questionnaire/$populate operation and QuestionnaireResponse/$extract.
These operations are used in data capture and exchange use cases and are used by downstream specifications such as DaVinci Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR) for prior authorization. 

Added support for the DaVinci DTR Questionnaire/$questionnaire-package operation.
This operation allows a Questionnaire to be packaged as a Bundle with all the supporting resources that may be required for its use such as ValueSets, Libraries, and so on.
This operation is used in context of prior authorization."
