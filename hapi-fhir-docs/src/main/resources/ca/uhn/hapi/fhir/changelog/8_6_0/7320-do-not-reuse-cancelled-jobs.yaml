type: fix
issue: 7320
title: "Previously, due to the asynchronicity of how cancelling a
      batch2 job works, it was possible to cancel a job and then start
      a new one (with the same parameters and allowing cache to be used)
      and this new job would use the old job id (which would then be cancelled).
      This has been fixed.
