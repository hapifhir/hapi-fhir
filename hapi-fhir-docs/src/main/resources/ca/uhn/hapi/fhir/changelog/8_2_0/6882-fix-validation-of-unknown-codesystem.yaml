jira: SMILE-9997
title: "Previously, submitting a resource for validation with an unknown CodeSystem would always result in a validation 
error, regardless of the defined binding strength. This has now been fixed such that, given an unknown CodeSystem: 
    <ul>
        <li>A <code>required</code> binding strength will still result in a validation error.</li>
        <li>An <code>extensible</code> binding strength will now result in a validation warning.</li>
        <li>A <code>preferred</code> binding strength will now result in a validation warning.</li>
        <li>An <code>example</code> binding strength will result in no issues.</li>
    </ul>"
