title: "When _Auto-Create Placeholder Reference Targets_ is enabled in combination 
  with _Populate Identifier In Auto Created Placeholder Reference Targets_ 
  and _Allow Inline Match URLs_, concurrent requests can create duplicate placeholder 
  resources which match a given conditional URL reference. This is now prevented 
  through the use of a database constraint like it is for other conditional 
  create/update operations."
