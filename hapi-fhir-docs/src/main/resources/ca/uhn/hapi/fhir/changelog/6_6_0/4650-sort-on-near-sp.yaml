title: "When performing a search using the Location:near search parameter, it is now possible
   to include this parameter in a `_sort` expression as well. This will result in locations being
   sorted by their proximity to the coordinates in the parameter value. Thanks to
   Jens Kristian Villadsen for the suggestion and algorithm design!"
