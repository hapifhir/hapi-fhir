title: "The JPA server FHIR transaction processor will now pre-fetch the target
   resource state for references to resources that don't also appear in the
   transaction bundle. This means that if you process a large FHIR transaction containing
   many references to other resources in the repository that are not also being
   updated in the same transaction, you should see a very significant improvement
   in performance."
