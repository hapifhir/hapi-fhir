issue: 4685
title: "Previously when the $everything operation was called on a Patient (or a search included _include or _revinclude
recursively), links from Provenance resources were traversed.  However this could have the unintended consequence of
traversing links for resources from other patients if two patients shared the same Provenance.  The new behaviour is
the Provenance is included in the output but none of its children are."
