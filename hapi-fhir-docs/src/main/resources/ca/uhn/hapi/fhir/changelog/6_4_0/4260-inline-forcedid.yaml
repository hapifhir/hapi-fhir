title: "The HFJ_RESOURCE table has a new column FHIR_ID which always contains the FHIR resource id,
   both client-assigned and server-assigned.
   This is parallel storage to allow gradual upgrade away from the current HFJ_FORCED_ID join table,
   which should improve performance in a future release."
