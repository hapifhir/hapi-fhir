title: "Add an ability to filter resources out of
        `$everything` and `$export` operations.
        This can be done via a newly created ISearchLimiterSvc.
        By default, no filtering is provided. But consumers
        may inject an ISearchLimiterSvc and specify which
        resources to filter on which operations.
        This is to allow consumers to filter out resources
        (for example, for security reasons),
        even if those resources are allowed by the spec.
