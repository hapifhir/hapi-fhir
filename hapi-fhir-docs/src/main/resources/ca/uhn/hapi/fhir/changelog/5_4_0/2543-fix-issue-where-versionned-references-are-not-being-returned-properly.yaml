issue: 2543
title: "When issuing a request for a specific Resource and also specifying an _include param, 
the proper historical referenced resource is not returned when there are more than 1 versions of the 
referenced resource available, after the reference has been changed from the original version 1 to some other version. 
When there are more than 1 versions available, and the referring resource had previously referred to version 1 
but now refers to version 4, the resource returned in the response bundle is for version 1."
