title: "The new Repositories builder supports creating instances of IRepository by urls.
  We include a limited in-memory implementation of IRepository useful for unit-testing
  that can be created with Repositories.repositoryForUrl(\"fhir-repository:memory:test-repo\", fhirContext).
  New implementations can be registered with a ServiceLoader.
  See IRepositoryLoader and InMemoryFhirRepositoryLoader for examples."
