title: "Added support for Oracle Database 23ai. The HapiFhirOracleDialect has been updated to properly handle boolean 
type mapping for Oracle 23, which introduced a native BOOLEAN type. The dialect now specifically maps boolean fields to
NUMERIC(1,0) columns for compatibility with existing schemas. Additionally, Oracle 23 embedded database support has 
been added to the test infrastructure, and the Oracle JDBC driver was upgraded to version 23.6.0.24.10."
