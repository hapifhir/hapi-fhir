type: fix
issue: 2643
title: "When using Auto-Version references in the JPA server, if an auto-versioned reference
  within a FHIR transaction pointed to a resource that did not actually change during the
  transaction (e.g. an update/PUT where the resource body was unchanged from the existing
  version), the reference would point to an incremented version number even though none existed.
  This has been corrected."
