title: "The HFQL/SQL engine incorrectly parsed expressions containing a `>=` or
   `<=` comparator in a WHERE clause. This has been corrected. Additionally, the
   execution engine has been optimized to apply clauses against the `meta.lastUpdated`
   path more efficiently by using the equivalent search parameter automatically."
