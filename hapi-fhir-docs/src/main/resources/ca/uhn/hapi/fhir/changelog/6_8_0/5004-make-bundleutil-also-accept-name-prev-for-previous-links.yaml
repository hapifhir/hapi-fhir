issue: 5004
title: "Previously when requesting `previous` or `prev` link using `BundleUtil.getLinkUrlOfType`, only the literal requested 
   link was returned. Now  when requesting either `previous` or `prev` `previous` or `prev` link is returned.
   If both exist, equality is validated and exception is thrown on failure."
