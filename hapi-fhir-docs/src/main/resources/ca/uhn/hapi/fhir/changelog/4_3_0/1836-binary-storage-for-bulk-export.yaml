title: "In HAPI FHIR 4.2.0, when performing a Bulk Export on a server with Binary Storage enabled, the bulk export files
   were not able to take advantage of the externalized binary stroage and would be stored in the relational DB. This has
   now been enhanced to allow bulk export files to store externally."
