title: "The Testpage Overlay module now supports customizable operation buttons
   on search results. For example, you can configure each row of the search
   results page to include a `$validate` button and a `$diff` button, or
   choose other operations relevant to your use case. Currently only
   operations which do not require any parameters are possible."
