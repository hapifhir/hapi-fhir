type: fix
issue: 5672
title: "Previously, when performing a FHIR search using a non-chained relative reference (returns entire resource) with 
a server assigned id, it ignores the invalid resourceType in the parameter value and proceeds with the id based lookup. e.g. 
 GET `/MedicationAdministration?context=abc/1352` returns `Encounter/1352`. This has been fixed."
