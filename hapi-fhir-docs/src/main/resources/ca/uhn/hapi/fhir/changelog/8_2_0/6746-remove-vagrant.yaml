issue: 6746
title: "A Vagrant-based development environment has been provided in the HAPI FHIR git repository
  for many years. It has not been maintained, and has therefore caused a number of CVE scanner
  failures due to outdated dependencies. At this point it is fairly straightforward to develop
  HAPI FHIR without any external dependencies, so this is being removed."
