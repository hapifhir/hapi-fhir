type: fix
issue: 3875
title: "Previously, when modifying one of the common search parameters, if the `Mark Resources For Reindexing Upon 
Search Parameter Change` configuration parameter was enabled, an invalid reindex batch job request would be created.
This has been fixed, and the batch job request will contain no URL constraints, causing all resources to be reindexed."
