type: change
issue: 2843
title: "Reverting the change to treat canonical references as local when setting the flag `getTreatBaseUrlsAsLocal()`. This
was added to address a bug in `_include` that didn't work for canonical URLs. This bug is now fixed
by resolving the `_include` search operation and as a result this change is no longer required."
