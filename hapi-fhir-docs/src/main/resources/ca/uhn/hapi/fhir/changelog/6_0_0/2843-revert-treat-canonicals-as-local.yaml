issue: 2843
title: "Reverting the change to treat canonical references as local when setting the flag `getTreatBaseUrlsAsLocal()`. This
was added to address a limitation in `_include` that did not process references by canonical URLs. 
The `_include` search operation now includes canonical references without special configuration."
