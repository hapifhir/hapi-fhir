title: "FhirPath PATCH operation has been updated to be spec complaint.
        This means it will now allow matching/replacing fhir paths that
        match to primitive values (String, int, datetime, etc).
        It also means that fhirpath patch will only support fhirpaths
        that match a singular element.
        Ie, if multiple (or no) elements match the provided fhir path,
        an error will result.
