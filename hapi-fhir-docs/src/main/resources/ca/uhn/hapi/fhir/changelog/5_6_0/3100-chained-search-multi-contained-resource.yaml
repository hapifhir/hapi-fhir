jira: SMILE-3151
title: "Previously, only contained resources that are referenced directly by the containing resource were being indexed.
This enhancement indexes the fields of contained resources that are referenced by other contained resources and
uses these new indices in chained searches. Note: in order to make use of this new capability, it must be enabled via
a configuration parameter and the repository must be re-indexed."
