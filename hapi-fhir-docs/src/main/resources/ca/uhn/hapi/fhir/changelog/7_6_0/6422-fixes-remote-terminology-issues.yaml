type: fix
issue: 6422
title: "Previously, since 7.4.4 the validation issue detail codes were not translated correctly for Remote Terminology 
validateCode calls. The detail code used was `invalid-code` for all use-cases which resulted in profile binding strength 
not being applied to the issue severity as expected when validating resources against a profile. 
This has been fixed and issue detail codes are translated correctly."
