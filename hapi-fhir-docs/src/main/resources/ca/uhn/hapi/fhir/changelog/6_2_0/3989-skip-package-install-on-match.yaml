title: "Provided the ability to have the NPM package installer skip installing a package if it is already installed and matches the version requested. This can be controlled by
the `reloadExisting` attribute in PackageInstallationSpec. It defaults to `true`, which is the existing behaviour. Thanks to  Craig McClendon (@XcrigX) for the contribution!"
