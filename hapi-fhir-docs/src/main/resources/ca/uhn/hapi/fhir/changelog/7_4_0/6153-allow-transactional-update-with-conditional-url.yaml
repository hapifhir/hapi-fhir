issue: 6153
title: "Previously, if you created a resource with some conditional url,
        but then submitted a transaction bundle that
        a) updated the resource to not match the condition anymore and
        b) create a resource with the (same) condition
        a unique index violation would result.
        
        This has been fixed.
