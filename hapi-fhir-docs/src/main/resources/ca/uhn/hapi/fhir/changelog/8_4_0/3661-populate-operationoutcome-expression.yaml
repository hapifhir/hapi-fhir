issue: 3661
title: "When performing a resource validation on R4+ servers, the generated
   OperationOutcome resource containing the validation results will now have
   the `OperationOutcome.issue.expression` element populated. This element
   contains a FHIRPath expression to the element containing the issue. The
   FHIR specification has deprecated the `OperationOutcome.issue.location`
   element. At this time, no change to the values placed in that element have
   been made, although it may no longer be populated in a future release of
   HAPI FHIR."
