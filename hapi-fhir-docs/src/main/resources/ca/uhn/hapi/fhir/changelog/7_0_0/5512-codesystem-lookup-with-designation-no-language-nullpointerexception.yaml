type: fix
issue: 5511
title: 'Previously, CodeSystem `$lookup` with Remote Terminology Service enabled would throw NullPointerException 
when the CodeSystem included designations with no language value. Also, there was an inconsistency between 
input and output type `string` vs. `code` for property parameters. These issues have been fixed.'
