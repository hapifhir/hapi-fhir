type: fix
issue: 6505
title: "Previously, when invoking a $validate operation that took more than 10s some unexpected errors 
would be returned which suggest the profile was not applied properly or used. 
That happens because the validation cache entry expired within the $validate call 
and the FHIR Core Validation library expects the same object instance for the same profile to be returned.
This has been fixed by increasing the cache expiry to 10min."
