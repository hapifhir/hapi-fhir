title: "Previously, resource body content went into one of 2 columns on the HFJ_RES_VER table: 
    RES_TEXT if the size was above a configurable threshold, or RES_TEXT_VC if it was below that 
    threshold. Performance testing has shown that the latter is always faster, and that on 
    Postgres the use of the latter is particularly problematic since it maps to the
    largeobject table which isn't the recommended way of storing high frequency objects. 
    The configurable threshold is now ignored, and the latter column is always used. Any legacy
    data in the former column will still be read however."
