title: "When processing `_include` and `_revinclude` directives on JPA server searches,
   the query will use a simplified SQL query which does not search for canonical URLs if the
   SearchParameter paths do not resolve to any elements which can potentially contain canonical
   references. Also, these searches now use a scrollable resultset for better efficiency."
