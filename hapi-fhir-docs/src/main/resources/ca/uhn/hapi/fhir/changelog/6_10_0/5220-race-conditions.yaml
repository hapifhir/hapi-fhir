type: fix
issue: 5220
title: "Fixed a race condition in RestfulClientFactory that could cause validateInitialized() to deadlock.
Fixed a race condition in FhirContext initialization that could produce a 'this.myNameToResourceType is null' NPE.
Fixed a shutdown hook memory leak in BaseApp that happened when the command threw an exception;
this memory leak only affects code that calls App.main repeatedly which is probably only in test code."
