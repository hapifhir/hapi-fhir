type: fix
issue: 7040
title: "Due to a fix in Release 8.2, contained resources
      will no longer have their ids prepended with a '#'.
      This caused a regression where contained resources were
      referenced, not by an Id Reference, but by the actual
      full embedded resource, would no longer be able to
      be processed in a transaction.
      To fix this, the parser/serializer (which is responsible
      for creating these contained reference ids) will also
      create a contained resource id reference, which does
      contain the prepended '#', thereby allowing these
      transactions to work as before.
"
