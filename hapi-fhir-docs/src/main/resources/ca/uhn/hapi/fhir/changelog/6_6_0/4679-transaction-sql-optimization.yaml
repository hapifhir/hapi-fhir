title: "When executing FHIR transactions in the JPA server where the transaction contained large numbers
  of inline match URLs, the transaction processor will now prefetch the match URL targets in a single 
  optimized batch. This avoids a potentially significant number of database round trips. In addition, 
  the SQL query used for pre-resolving resource update targets in the transaction processor has been 
  reworked to fully leverage available database indexes. This should result in significant performance
  improvements for certain large FHIR transactions."
