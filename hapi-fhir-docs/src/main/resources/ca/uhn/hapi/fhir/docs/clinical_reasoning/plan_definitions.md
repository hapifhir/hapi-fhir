# PlanDefinition

## Introduction

The FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module defines the [PlanDefinition resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html) and several [associated operations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition-operations.html). A plan definition is a pre-defined group of actions to be taken in particular circumstances, often including conditional elements, options, and other decision points. The resource is flexible enough to be used to represent a variety of workflows, as well as clinical decision support and quality improvement assets, including order sets, protocols, and decision support rules.

PlanDefinitions can contain hierarchical groups of action definitions, where each action definition describes an activity to be performed (often in terms of an ActivityDefinition resource), and each group defines additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall definition.

In addition to describing what should take place, each action in a plan definition can specify when and whether the action should take place. For when the action should be taken, the trigger element specifies the action should be taken in response to some trigger occurring (such as a particular point in a workflow being reached, or as the result of a prescription being ordered). For whether the action should be taken, the condition element can be used to provide an expression that evaluates to true or false to indicate the applicability of the action to the specific context.

The process of applying a PlanDefinition to a particular context typically produces request resources representing the actions that should be performed, grouped within a RequestOrchestration to capture relationships between the resulting request resources.

Each ActivityDefinition is used to construct a specific resource, based on the definition of the activity and combined with contextual information for the particular patient that the plan definition is being applied to.

## Operations

HAPI implements the [$apply](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/OperationDefinition-cpg-plandefinition-apply.html) operation. Support for additional operations is planned.

## Apply

The `$apply` operation applies a PlanDefinition to a given context. This implementation follows the [FHIR Specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html#12.23.4.3) and supports the [FHIR Clinical Guidelines IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/index.html). In addition, an R5 version of apply is made available for R4 instances.  This will cause $apply to return a Bundle of resources instead of a CarePlan.  This can be invoked with `$r5.apply`.

### Example PlanDefinition

Some example PlanDefinition workflows are available in the [opioid-cds-r4](https://github.com/cqframework/opioid-cds-r4) IG. Full Bundles with all the required supporting resources are available [here](https://github.com/cqframework/opioid-cds-r4/tree/1e543f781138f3d85404b7f65a92ff713519ef2c/bundles). You can download a Bundle and load it on your server as a transaction:

```bash
POST http://your-server-base/fhir opioidcds-10-patient-view-bundle.json
```

These Bundles do not include example Patient clinical data. Applying a PlanDefinition can be invoked with:

```bash
GET http://your-server-base/fhir/PlanDefinition/opioidcds-10-patient-view/$apply?subject=Patient/patientId&encounter=Encounter/encounterId&practitioner=Practitioner/practitionerId
```

### Additional Parameters

The following additional parameters are supported for the `$apply` and `$r5.apply` operation:

| Parameter | Type       | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| organization        | String     | The organization in context                                                                                                    |
| userType            | String     | The type of user initiating the request, e.g. patient, healthcare provider, or specific type of healthcare provider (physician, nurse, etc.) |
| userLanguage        | String     | Preferred language of the person using the system |
| userTaskContext     | String     | The task the system user is performing, e.g. laboratory results review, medication list review, etc. This information can be used to tailor decision support outputs, such as recommended information resources |
| setting             | String     | The current setting of the request (inpatient, outpatient, etc.) |
| settingContext      | String     | Additional detail about the setting of the request, if any |
| parameters          | Parameters | Any input parameters defined in libraries referenced by the PlanDefinition. |
| data                | Bundle     | Data to be made available to the PlanDefinition evaluation. |
| dataEndpoint        | Endpoint   | An endpoint to use to access data referenced by retrieve operations in libraries referenced by the PlanDefinition. |
| contentEndpoint     | Endpoint   | An endpoint to use to access content (i.e. libraries) referenced by the PlanDefinition. |
| terminologyEndpoint | Endpoint   | An endpoint to use to access terminology (i.e. valuesets, codesystems, and membership testing) referenced by the PlanDefinition. |


## Package

The `package` operation for [PlanDefinition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html) will generate a Bundle of resources that includes the PlanDefinition as well as any related resources which can then be shared. This implementation follows the [CRMI IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/crmi-ig/branches/master/index.html) guidance for [packaging artifacts](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/crmi-ig/branches/master/packaging.html).
