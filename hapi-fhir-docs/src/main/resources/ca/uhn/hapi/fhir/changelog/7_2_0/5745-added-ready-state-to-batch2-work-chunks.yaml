title: "Added another state to the Batch2 work chunk state machine: `READY`.
        This work chunk state will be the initial state on creation.
        Once queued for delivery, they will transition to `QUEUED`.
        The exception is for ReductionStep chunks (because reduction steps
        are not read off of the queue, but executed by the maintenance job
        inline.
"
