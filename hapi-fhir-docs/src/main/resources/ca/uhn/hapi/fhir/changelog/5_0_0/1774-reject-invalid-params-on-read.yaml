title: The REST Server will now raise an error if a client tries to perform a FHIR *read* operation while using
   URL paramaters that are specific to FHIR *search* operations. This should help clients who are mistaking the
   semantics between the two operations, as previously the search parameters were simply ignored leading to
   confusion. Thanks to Jafer Khan for implementing this!
