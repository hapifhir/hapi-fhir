title: "Previously, the HAPI FHIR CLI commands that made HTTP requests could only be used for HTTP endpoints. 
This feature adds support for HTTPS endpoints by using TLS authentication for `ExampleDataUploader`, 
`ExportConceptMapToCsvCommand`, `ImportCsvToConceptMapCommand`, `ReindexTerminologyCommand` and 
`UploadTerminologyCommand`."
