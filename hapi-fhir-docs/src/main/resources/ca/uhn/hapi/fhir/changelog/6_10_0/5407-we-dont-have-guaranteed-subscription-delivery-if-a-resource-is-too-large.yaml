title: "Previously, when the payload of a subscription message exceeds the broker maximum message size, exception would 
be thrown and retry will be performed indefinitely until the maximum message size is adjusted. Now, the message will be
successfully delivered for rest-hook and email subscriptions, while message subscriptions remains the same behavior as
before."
