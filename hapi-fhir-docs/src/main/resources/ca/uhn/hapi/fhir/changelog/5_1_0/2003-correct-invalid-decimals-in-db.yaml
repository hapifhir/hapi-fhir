type: fix
issue: 2003
title: "In HAPI FHIR 4.2.0 and before, due to the lenient Gson parser it was possible to store data in the JPA server
  that contained invalid decimal numbers with no leading digits, e.g. `.123` and `-.123`. When we moved to Jackson as a JSON
  parser, these values could no longer be parsed due to Jackson's more strict (and correct) interpretation of the JSON
  specification. Unfortunately this led to data previously stored in the database being unusable. A fix has been implemented that
  automatically adds a leading zero to any decimals that were previously saved in invalid state. New data will still be blocked from
  being added if it contains invalid JSON numbers."
