type: fix
issue: 3700
jira: SMILE-4488
title: "Previously, Group Bulk Export would expand into other groups, due to the nature of `Group.member` being part of the patient search compartment.
This has been fixed, and now, Group Bulk Export will only ever export the Group resource specified in the request, regardless of patient membership."
