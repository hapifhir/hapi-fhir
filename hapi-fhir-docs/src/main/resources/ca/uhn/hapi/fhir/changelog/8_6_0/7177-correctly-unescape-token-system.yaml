issue: 7177
title: "Identifier systems containing characters needing FHIR's backslash escaping in the identifier system (e.g. `\"identifier\": [{\"system\":\"http://foo,123\", \"ABC\"}]`) can not be searched for using standard escaping (`Patient?identifier=http://foo\,123|ABC`) due to a bug in the search unescaping logic. This 10-year old bug has been corrected."
