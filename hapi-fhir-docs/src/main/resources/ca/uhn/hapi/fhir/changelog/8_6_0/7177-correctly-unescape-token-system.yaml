issue: 7177
title: "Identifier systems containing characters needing FHIR's backslash escaping in the
  identifier system (e.g. an identifier with a system value of `http://foo,123`) can 
  not be searched for using standard escaping (`Patient?identifier=http://foo\\,123|ABC`) due
  to a bug in the search unescaping logic. This 10-year old bug has been corrected."
