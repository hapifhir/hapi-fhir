title: "These changes are related to bumping the dependency on org.hl7.fhir.core to version 5.3.0.
The main updates that resulted in the majority of the changes in this PR were the addition of the interface IValidationPolicyAdvisor,
and the refactoring of some of the main validation classes (for cleaning purposes). Also, many of the error messages were
updated, so the resulting tests in HAPI had to be modified to reflect these message changes.

In regard to the new interface IValidationPolicyAdvisor, by implementing this interface and passing it through the
validation context in HAPI to the InstanceValidator in the core libraries, users can now control the behavior of the
validator when validating references, contained resources, and coded content. Previously, only references were controlled
in this way, and users controlled this by overriding the validation fetcher.

Test cases were added in the validation test cases repository to demonstrate it's functionality. In particular, the two
test cases contained-resource-bad-id, and contained-resource-bad-id-ignore. The definitions and expected outcomes of
these test cases are in the manifest.json in that repository."
