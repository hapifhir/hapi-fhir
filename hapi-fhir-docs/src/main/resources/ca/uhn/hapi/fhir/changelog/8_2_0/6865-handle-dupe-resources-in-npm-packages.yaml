title: "Added new NPM package management APIs to help manage duplicate resources by canonical URL across multiple packages. `IHapiPackageCacheManager` has two new methods:
<ul>
    <li>`List<NpmPackageAssetInfoJson> findPackageAssetInfoByUrl(FhirVersionEnum theVersion, String theCanonicalUrl)`: Shows details of the packages that are duplicated with url</li>
    <li>`IBaseResource findPackageAsset(FindPackageAssetRequest theFindPackageAssetRequest)`: Allows viewing the specific resource JSON for that canonical URL, package ID and version to help determine which is the resource and package that should be kept.</li>
</ul>
"
