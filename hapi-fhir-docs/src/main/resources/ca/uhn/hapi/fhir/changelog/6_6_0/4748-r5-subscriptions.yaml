title: "Previously, HAPI-FHIR converted R5 Subscriptions into R4 Subscriptions and triggered those subscriptions by 
resource changes in the same way R4 subscriptions are triggered. Now R5 Subscriptions are triggered based on the topic
they subscribe to and the resource matching happens via the SubscriptionTopic resource. This also means that
R5 Subscription endpoints are now delivered a subscription-notification Bundle as opposed to the resource as is the
case with R4 Subscriptions."
