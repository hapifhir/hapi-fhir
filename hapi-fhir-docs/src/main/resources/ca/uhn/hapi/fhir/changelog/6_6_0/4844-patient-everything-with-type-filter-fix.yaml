type: fix
issue: 4844
title: "/Patient/{patientid}/$everything?_type={resource types}
   would omit resources that were not directly related to the Patient
   resource (even if those resources were specified in the _type list).
   This was in conflict with /Patient/{patientid}/$everything operation,
   which did return said resources.
   This has been fixed so both return all related resources, even if
   those resources are not directly related to the Patient resource.
