issue: 5229
title: "Previously, when using INLINE tag storage mode, a superfluous version of a resource would be created as a result
  of an update request which didn't have a real logical change to the resource but only changed the order of existing
  items in tag, security label or profile collections. This change prevents this behaviour. Also on resource retrieval,
  these meta collections are sorted alphabetically, based on (security, code) pair for tags and security labels."
