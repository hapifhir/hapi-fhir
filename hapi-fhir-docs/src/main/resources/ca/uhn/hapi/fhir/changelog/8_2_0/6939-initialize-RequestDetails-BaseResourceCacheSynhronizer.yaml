type: fix
issue: 6939
title: "BaseResourceCacheSynchronizer class, which is mainly used for caching Subscription and 
SubscriptionTopic resources, was using a null RequestDetails object when querying the database, if its 
`requestRefresh` method is called before the `registerListener` method during initialization. This has now been fixed."
