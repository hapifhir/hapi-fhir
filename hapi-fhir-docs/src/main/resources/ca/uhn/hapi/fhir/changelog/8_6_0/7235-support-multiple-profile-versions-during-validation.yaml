type: fix
issue: 7235
jira: SMILE-10652
title: "Previously, when uploading multiple versions of a profile through the Package Registry, the business version would
be ignored which caused conformance resources that shared the same canonical URL to be overwritten. This has now been fixed,
and support for validation with versioned canonical URLs has been added."
