type: fix
issue: 4128
title: "In the JPA server, when deleting a resource the associated tags were previously deleted even though
  the FHIR specification states that tags are independent of FHIR versioning. After this fix, resource tags
  and security labels will remain when a resource is deleted. They can be fetched using the `$meta` operation
  against the deleted resource, and will remain if the resource is brought back in a subsequent update."
