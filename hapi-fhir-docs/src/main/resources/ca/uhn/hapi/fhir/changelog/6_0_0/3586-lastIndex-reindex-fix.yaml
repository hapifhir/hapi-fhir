jira: SMILE-3441
title: "While converting the reindexing job to the new batch framework, a regression of [#3441](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/3441) was introduced. Reindexing jobs were not respecting the passed in `_lastUpdated` parameter.
  We now take date these date ranges into account when running re-indexing jobs."
