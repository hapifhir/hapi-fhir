title: "The `ActionRequestDetails` class has been dropped (it has been deprecated 
   since HAPI FHIR 4.0.0). This class was used as a parameter to the 
   `SERVER_INCOMING_REQUEST_PRE_HANDLED` interceptor pointcut, but can be
   replaced in any existing client code with `RequestDetails`. This change
   also removes an undocumented behaviour where the JPA server internally
   invoked the `SERVER_INCOMING_REQUEST_PRE_HANDLED` a second time from
   within various processing methods. This behaviour caused performance
   problems for some interceptors (e.g. `SearchNarrowingInterceptor`) and
   no longer offers any benefit so it is being removed."
