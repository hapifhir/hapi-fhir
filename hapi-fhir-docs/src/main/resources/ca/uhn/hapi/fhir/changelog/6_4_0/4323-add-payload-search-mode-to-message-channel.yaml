title: "Previously, the feature of Payload Search Result Mode only applies to REST HOOK subscriptions only.
Now, this feature also applies to Message channel type. Message delivery module will perform a search using 
user-defined criteria and the search result will be delivered to the user-specified endpoint channel as bundle
resources when Payload Search Result Mode is used."
