title: "When using JPA persistence with Hibernate Search (Lucene or Elasticsearch), simple FHIR queries that can be 
 satisfied completely by Hibernate Search no longer query the database.  Before, every search involved the database,
 even when not needed.  This is faster when there are many results."
