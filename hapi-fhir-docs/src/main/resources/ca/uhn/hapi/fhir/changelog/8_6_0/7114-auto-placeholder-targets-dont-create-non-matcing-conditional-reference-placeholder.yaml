issue: 7114
title: "When _Auto-Create Placeholder Reference Targets_ is enabled in combination 
  with _Allow Inline Match URLs_, a placeholder reference was incorrectly created 
  if a conditional URL reference could not be resolved, even though the placeholder 
  reference would not actually satisfy the conditional URL. This has been corrected 
  and no placeholder resource will be created (meaning that the operation will now 
  fail unless _Populate Identifier In Auto Created Placeholder Reference Targets_ is 
  also enabled)."
