type: fix
issue: 6862
title: "Modifier extensions with child modifier extensions were incorrectly serialized by the
  JSON Parser using the element name `modifierExtension`. This was incorrect (the child element
  should always be called `extension` per the [spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/extensibility.html#modifierExtension)).
  Thanks to Vytis Valentinaviƒçius for the contribution!"
