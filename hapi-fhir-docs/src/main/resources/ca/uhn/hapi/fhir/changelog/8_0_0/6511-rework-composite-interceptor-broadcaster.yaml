title: "Interceptors can be defined against the registry on the RestfulServer, or on
  the registry in the JPA repository. Because these are separate registries, the order()
  attribute on the Hook annotation isn't correctly processed today across the two 
  registries. The CompositeInterceptorRegistry has been reworked so ordering will be
  respected across both registries."
