title: "In the JPA server, when indexing Date SearchParameters where the value being indexed is a
   FHIR Period that is missing either a lower bound or an upper bound, a default value representing an 
   extreme 'beginning of time' or 'end of time' is now used. This allows range searches to return more
   accurate results."
