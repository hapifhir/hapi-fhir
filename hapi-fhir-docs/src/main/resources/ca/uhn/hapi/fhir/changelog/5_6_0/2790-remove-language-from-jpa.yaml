issue: 2790
title: "Support for the `_language` search parameter has been dropped from the JPA server. This search parameter
  was specified in FHIR DSTU1 but was dropped in later versions. It is rarely used in practice and imposes
  an indexing cost, so it has now been removed. A custom search parameter may be used in order to achieve
  the same functionality if needed."
