type: fix
issue: 4180
title: "Before DB table joins were `LEFT OUTER` by default, which was causing some queries to skip table indexes, making them 
   very slow. This was more noticeable in H2 database, but affected all DB types in different measures. This has been fixed by
   using `INNER` joins, unless specific use case requires otherwise."
