type: fix
issue: 5690
title: "Previously, a DELETE on a specific URL search string would always attempt to delete no matter the number of
        resolved resources.
        This has been fixed by adding a storage setting to enforce a threshold for resolved resources, above which
        the DELETE operation will fail to execute with HAPI-2496."
