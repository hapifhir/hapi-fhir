title: "Previously, when updating an MDM link to NO_MATCH,
      the golden resource involved would maintain its previous
      values, as defined by survivorship service.
      This would result in out-of-date golden resources with
      data that might not be accurate anymore.
      Now, when a link is changed to NO_MATCH, golden resources
      will be rebuilt from the ground up using the MDM survivorship
      service, and the set of links/source resources available at the
      time of update.
