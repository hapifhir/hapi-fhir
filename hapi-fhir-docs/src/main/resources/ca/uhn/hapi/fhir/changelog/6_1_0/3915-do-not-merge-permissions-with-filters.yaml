type: fix
issue: 3915
title: "When multiple permissions exist for a user, granting access to the same compartment for different
owners, the permissions will be collapsed into one rule. Previously, if these permissions had filters, only the
the filter of the first permission in the list would be applied, but it would apply to all of the owners.
This has been fixed by turning off the collapse function for permissions with filters, converting each one
to a separate rule."
