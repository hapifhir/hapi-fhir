jira: SMILE-8604
title: "Previously, `$apply-codesystem-delta-add` and `$apply-codesystem-delta-remove` operations were failing 
with a 500 Server Error when invoked with a CodeSystem Resource payload that had a concept without a  
`display` element. This has now been fixed so that concepts without display field is accepted, as `display` 
element is not required."
