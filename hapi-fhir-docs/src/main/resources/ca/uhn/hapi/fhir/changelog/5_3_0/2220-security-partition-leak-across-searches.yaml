title: "An important security issue with the JPA Server was solved. This issue applies only to JPA servers running
  in partitioned mode. When performing searches on a partitioned server, search results from previously cached
  searches against different partitions may be returned, potentially leaking data across partitions. This issue
  has been resolved."
