title: "Add rawHttpRequest() get call to IGenericClient so that non standard FHIR calls can be made while still able to make
use of the interceptor infrastructure. The methods returns a IRawHttp with upon execution returns an IEntityResult with
the mime type, status code, headers and an input stream as a representation of the response.
Example usage of the client: client.rawHttpRequest().get(\"someurl?param1=value1\").execute()"
