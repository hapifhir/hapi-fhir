title: "The Bulk Import ($import) operation has been reworked for much improved performance and functionality:
   <ul>
   <li>
      The storage step now uses FHIR transactions to ingest chunks of data, with automatic retry and 
      a batch failure mode. This should result in both better performance, and better job stability for
      large jobs.
   </li>
   <li>
      The job will now produce a report at the end of the process which details the outcome of the job.
   </li>
   <li>
      The HAPI FHIR CLI bulk-import job will now output this report at the end of execution.
   </li>
   </ul>"
