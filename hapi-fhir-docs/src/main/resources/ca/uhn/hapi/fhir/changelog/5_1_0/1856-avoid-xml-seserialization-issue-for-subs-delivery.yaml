type: fix
issue: 1856
title: "The subscription delivery queue in the JPA server was erroneously keeping both a copy of the serialized and the
   deserialized payload in memory for each entry in the queue, doubling the memory requirements. This also caused failures
   when delivering XML payloads in some configurations. This has been corrected."
