type: fix
issue: 6124
title: "Previously, when retrieving a resource which may contain other resources, such as a document Bundle, 
if a ConsentService's willSeeResource returned AUTHORIZED or REJECT on this parent resource, the willSeeResource was 
still being called for the child resources. This has now been fixed so that if a consent service 
returns AUTHORIZED or REJECT for a parent resource, willSeeResource is not called for the child resources."
