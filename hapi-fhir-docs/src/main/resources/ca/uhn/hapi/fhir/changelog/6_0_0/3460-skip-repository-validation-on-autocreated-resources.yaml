backport: 5.7.1
title: "Previously, during RepositoryValidation, we would perform validation on resources created via DaoConfig's `setAutoCreatePlaceholderReferenceTargets` property. This caused validation failures on placeholder resources
as they do not conform to any profile. This has been changed, and Repository Validation will not occur on any resource containing an extension with URL http://hapifhir.io/fhir/StructureDefinition/resource-placeholder`."
