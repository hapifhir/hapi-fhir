title: "Previously, when a search query explicitly includes a search parameter that is for the same resource type but a
different resource instance from the one(s) specified on the authorized list, the search narrowing interceptor would include
both search parameters in the final query, resulting in an empty bundle being returned to the caller. Now, such a call
will result in a 403 Forbidden error, making it more clear why no resources were returned."
