issue: 5547
title: "Previously LIKE queries against resources would perform poorly on PostgreSQL if the database locale/collation was not 'C'.
        This has been resolved by checking hfj_spidx_string.sp_value_normalized and hfj_spidx_uri.sp_uri column
        collations during migration and if either or both are non C, create a new btree varchar_pattern_ops on the
        hash values.  If both column collations are 'C', do not create any new indexes."
