title: "The `$reindex` operation has been refactored to take advantage of the new Bulk Modification Batch2 framework. This means that Reindex jobs now:

* Provide a more helpful response when initially starting the job
* Support polling for job completion status updates
* Generate a report outlining the results of the operation, and make this report available to REST clients through the polling API
* Support partitioning when operating in both NAMED and UNNAMED partition naming modes"
