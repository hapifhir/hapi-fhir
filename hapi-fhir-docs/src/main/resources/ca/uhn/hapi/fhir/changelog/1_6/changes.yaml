    title: "Performance has been improved for the initial FhirContext object creation by avoiding a lot of unnecessary reflection. HAPI FHIR 1.5 had a regression compared to previous releases and this has been corrected, but other improvements have been made so that this release is faster than previous releases too. <br/><br/> In addition, a new \"deferred scan\" mode has been implemented for even faster initialization on slower environments (e.g. Android). See the performance documentation for more information. <br/><br/> The following shows our benchmarks for context initialization across several versions of HAPI: <ul> <li>Version 1.4: <b>560ms</b></li> <li>Version 1.5: <b>800ms</b></li> <li>Version 1.6: <b>340ms</b></li> <li>Version 1.6 (deferred mode): <b>240ms</b></li> </ul>"

    title: "REST server now throws an HTTP 400 instead of an HTTP 500 if an operation which takes a FHIR resource in the request body (e.g. create, update) contains invalid content that the parser is unable to parse. Thanks to Jim Steel for the suggestion!"

    type: "add"
    title: "Deprecate fluent client search operations without an explicit declaration of the bundle type being used. This also means that in a client <code>.search()</code> operation, the <code>.returnBundle(Bundle.class)</code> needs to be the last statement before <code>.execute()</code>"
- item:
    issue: "346"
    type: "add"
    title: "Server now respects the parameter <code>_format=application/xml+fhir\"</code> which is technically invalid since the + should be escaped, but is likely to be used. Also, a parameter of <code>_format=html</code> can now be used, which forces SyntaxHighlightingInterceptor to use HTML even if the headers wouldn't otherwise trigger it. Thanks to Jim Steel for reporting!"

    type: "fix"
    title: "Improve performance when parsing large bundles by fixing a loop over all of the entries inthe bundle to stitch together cross-references, which was happening once per entry instead of once overall. Thanks to Erick on the HAPI FHIR Google Group for noticing that this was an issue!"
- item:
    type: "remove"
    title: "JSON parser no longer allows the resource ID to be specified in an element called \"_id\" (the correct one is \"id\"). Previously _id was allowed because some early FHIR examples used that form, but this was never actually valid so it is now being removed."
- item:
    type: "add"
    title: "JPA server now allows \"forced IDs\" (ids containing non-numeric, client assigned IDs) to use the same logical ID part on different resource types. E.g. A server may now have both Patient/foo and Observation/foo on the same server. <br/><br/> Note that existing databases will need to modify index \"IDX_FORCEDID\" as it is no longer unique, and perform a reindexing pass."

    issue: "350"
    type: "fix"
    title: "When serializing/encoding custom types which replace exsting choice fields by fixing the choice to a single type, the parser would forget that the field was a choice and would use the wrong name (e.g. \"abatement\" instead of \"abatementDateType\"). Thanks to Yaroslav Kovbas for reporting and providing a unit test!"

    title: "When updating a resource via an update operation on the server, if the ID of the resource is not present in the resource body but is present on the URL, this will now be treated as a warning instead of as a failure in order to be a bit more tolerant of errors. If the ID is present in the body but does not agree with the ID in the URL this remains an error."

HTML content can now be forced via the (previously existing) <code>_format=html</code> or via the two newly added values <code>_format=html/json</code> and <code>_format=html/xml</code> .
