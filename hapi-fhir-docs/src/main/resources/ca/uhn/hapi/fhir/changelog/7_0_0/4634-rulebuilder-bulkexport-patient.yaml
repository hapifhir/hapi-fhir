type: fix
issue: 4634
title: "Previously, rule builder could not effectively handle Patient Type-Level Exports. It would over-permit requests
    in certain scenarios. This fix allows for accumulation of ids on a Patient Type-Level Bulk export to enable us to 
    properly match the requested Patient IDs against the users permitted Patient IDs."
