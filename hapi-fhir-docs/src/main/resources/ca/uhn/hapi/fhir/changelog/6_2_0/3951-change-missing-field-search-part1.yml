title: "Changing the way missing field searches work.
      Currently, a user must enable IndexMissingFields flag
      in order to be able to search on missing fields at all.
      However, this search takes a lot of extra space and is
      slower if searching for fields that are not missing
      amongst many similarly typed resources.
      This change begins a migration process that will allow searching
      on missing fields without enabling IndexMissingFields flag.
      This first step will be faster in looking for fields that are not
      missing. However, it will be slower for looking for fields that are
      missing if there are many (similarly typed) resources to search over.
      The type of search used will be determined by the IndexMissingFields flag:
      if it is Enabled, the old method is used. If disabled, the new method is used.
      The 2 searches are not compatible. And changes from one to the other
      require a call to /$reindex in order to gather correct results.
