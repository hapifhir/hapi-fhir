type: add
title: "Previously, updating an existing resource (resource A) to match a resource that
   it didn't match to before (resource B) would update only the already
   existing links on resource A.
   This behaviour has been changed. Now such an update will also add additional links,
   if necessary, from resource A to resource B, including adding a POSSIBLE_DUPLICATE
   between golden resource A and golden resource B.
