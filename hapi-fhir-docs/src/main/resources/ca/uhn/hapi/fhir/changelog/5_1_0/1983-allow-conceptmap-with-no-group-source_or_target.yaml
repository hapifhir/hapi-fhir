type: fix
issue: 1983
title: "ConceptMap resources were blocked from uploading into the JPA server if the ConceptMap had a source
    and/or target URL defined at the ConceptMap level but not at the group level. This prevented some US Core
    resources from being successfully uploaded. This has been corrected."
