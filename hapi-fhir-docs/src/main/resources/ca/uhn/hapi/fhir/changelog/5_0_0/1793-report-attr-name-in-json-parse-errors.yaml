issue: 1793
title: "When parsing JSON resources, if an element contains an invalid value, the Parser Error Handler
   did not have access to the actual name of the element being parsed. This meant that errors lacked useful
   detail in order to diagnose the issue. This has been corrected. Thanks to GitHub user
   @jwalter for reporting!"
