title: "By default, referential integrity is enforced on deletes.
        This change introduces support for an exceptional case such
        that deletion of a given resource will not be blocked if all
        references to that resource are versioned. If there is at
        least one unversioned reference to the resource, deletion will
        still be blocked.
