title: "Previously, if a unique or non-unique combo SeaerchParameter was
  defined, it would not be used by searches if any parameter contained
  multiple OR clauses (e.g. `Patient?family=simpson&given=homer,marge`).
  Such searches will now use the combo index table, which should result
  in much more performant searches in some cases."
