type: fix
issue: 7479
title: "The expandMdm field in bulk export operations now properly supports 
  tri-state logic to distinguish between explicitly disabled (false), 
  explicitly enabled (true), and not specified (null). This allows the system 
  to apply appropriate default behavior when the _mdm parameter set explicitly 
  to false as opposed to being omitted"
