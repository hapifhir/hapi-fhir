issue: 1855
title: "A very old feature that is not believed to be used anywhere has been removed: The ServerProfileProvider is
   a special resource provider that was automatically registered to HAPI FHIR REST servers, and served up StructureDefinitions
   that were registered to the FhirContext. Registering custom StructureDefinitions against the FhirContext for exposure through
   the REST API (as what was then the /Profile endpoint) was planned to be a common feature during the DSTU1 lifecycle but
   did not turn out to be a useful approach. This feature was mostly forgotten about until the logic for selecting resource
   provider handler methods was revamped and the old mechanism suddenly became the default resource provider for StructureDefinition
   resources in the JPA server. We don't expect any negative impact by this change, please post in our mailing list if you
   disagree."
