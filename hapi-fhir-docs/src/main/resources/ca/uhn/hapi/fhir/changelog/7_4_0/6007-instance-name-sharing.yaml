issue: 6007
title: "Previously, HAPI-FHIR schedulers were automatically suffixing the Quartz scheduler's `org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName` value to a unique autogenerated value based on the provided instance name. This
has been corrected, and now the instance name provided to the BaseHapiFhirScheduler is used directly, with no unique suffix added. This is in line with the [Quartz Documentation](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.1.7/configuration/ConfigMain.html) related
to defining the scheduler instance name for those who run schedulers in a cluster."
