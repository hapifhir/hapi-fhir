jira: SMILE-7270
title: "Previously, with validation active, when a user POSTed a resource with a meta profile with a non-existent 
        StructureDefinition URL, then POSTed the StructureDefinition, POSTing the same or another patient with that same 
        meta profile URL would still fail with a VALIDATION_VAL_PROFILE_UNKNOWN_NOT_POLICY validation error.
        This has been fixed."
