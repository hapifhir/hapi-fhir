    title: "**Breaking Change**:
    The HAPI FHIR Validation infrastructure has changed significantly under the hood. Existing users of the
    validator may need to change package declarations (as FhirInstanceValidator and several other related classes
    have been moved) and potentially add new modules to their Validation Support Chain. See
    [Migrating to HAPI FHIR 5.x](/hapi-fhir/docs/validation/instance_validator.html#migrating-to-hapi-fhir-5x)
    for details on how to account for this change in your code.

     title: "**Breaking Change**:
    The `IFluentPath` interface has been renamed to `IFhirPath`, and the `FhirContext#newFluentPath()` method
    has been replaced with an equivalent `FhirContext.newFhirPath()`. The FhirPath expression language was initially
    called FluentPath before being renamed, so this change brings HAPI FHIR inline with the correct naming.

     title: "**Breaking Change**:
    Several classes in the JPA server have been moved to new packages, including the DaoConfig and IDao interfaces.
    These classes have not changed in terms of functionality, but existing projects may need to adjust some
    package import statements.

     title: "**Breaking Change**:
    The Generic/Fluent **delete()** operation now returns a [MethodOutcome](/hapi-fhir/apidocs/hapi-fhir-base/ca/uhn/fhir/rest/api/MethodOutcome.html)
    object instead of an OperationOutcome. The OperationOutcomoe is still available direcly by querying
    the MethodOutcome object, but this change makes the delete() method more consistent with
    other similar methods in the API.

     title: "**Breaking Change**:
    Some R4 and R5 structure fields containing a `code` value with a **Required (closed) binding**
    did not use the java Enum type that was generated for the given field. These have been changed
    to use the Enum values where possible. This change does not remove any functionality from the model
    but may require a small amount of re-coding to deal with new setter/getter types on a few fields.

     title: "**New Feature**:
    A new feature has been added to the JPA server called **[Partitioning](/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_partitioning/partitioning.html). This
    feature allows data to be segregated using a user defined partitioning strategy. This can be leveraged to take
    advantags of native RDBMS partition strategies, and also to implement **multitenant servers**.
