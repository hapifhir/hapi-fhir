title: "Added support for CDS on FHIR PlanDefinitions that use the CRMI Effective Data Requirements extension when
    creating the JSON for the Service Discovery. Also added support for use of the FHIR Query Pattern extension when
    generating Prefetch Templates for Service Discovery. If a DataRequirement has FHIR Query Pattern extensions they
    will be used, otherwise Prefetch Templates will be generated."
