issue: 1801
title: "When invoking JPA DAO methods programatically to store a resource (as opposed to using the FHIR REST API), if
  the resource being stored had any contained resources, these would sometimes not be visible to the search parameter
  indexer, leading to missing search params. This is a very fringe use case, but a workaround has been put in place to
  solve it."
