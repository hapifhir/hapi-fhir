type: fix
issue: 7065
title: "Previously, if partitioning mode was enabled and a Group resource didn't have a Patient member,
the PatientIdPartitionInterceptor would throw an error during a CREATE/PUT, leading to an unsuccessful group creation or update. This has been fixed and the Group resource in the request will be placed in the default partition."
