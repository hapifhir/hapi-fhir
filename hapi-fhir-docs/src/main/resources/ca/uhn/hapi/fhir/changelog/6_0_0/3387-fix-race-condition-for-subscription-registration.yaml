type: fix
issue: 3387
title: "A race condition in the Subscription processor meant that a Subscription could fail to 
  register right away if it was modified immediately after being created. Note that this issue only
  affects rapid changes, and only caused the subscription to be unregistered for a maximum of one minute
  after its initial creation so the impact of this issue is expected to be low."
