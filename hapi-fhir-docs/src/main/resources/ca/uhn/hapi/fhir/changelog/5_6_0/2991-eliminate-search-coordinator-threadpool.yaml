title: "This PR eliminates the search coordinator threadpool, and executes searches synchronously on the HTTP client 
   thread. The idea of using a separate pool was supposed to help improve server scalability, but ultimately created
   false bottlenecks and reduced the utility of monitoring infrastructure so it has been eliminated."
