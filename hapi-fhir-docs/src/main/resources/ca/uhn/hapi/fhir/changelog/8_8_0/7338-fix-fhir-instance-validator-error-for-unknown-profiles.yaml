type: fix
issue: 7338
title: "A regression in HAPI FHIR 8.2 meant that setting FhirInstanceValidator.setErrorForUnknownProfiles(false) had no effect.
        This has been fixed while ensuring $validate always returns an error if the profile specified in the 'profile' parameter is unknown, as required by the FHIR specification.
