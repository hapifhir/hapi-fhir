issue: 6845
title: "Recent versions of the HAPI FHIR corelib (containing model classes, fhirpath evaluator, 
validator, etc.) now enforce a rule that contained resources must not have a # character in
their ID, so the # character is only used in the reference. In other words, when adding a
contained resource to a containing resource, the contained resource should now have an ID
set as follows:

```java
Organization org = new Organization();
org.setId(\"1\"); // Previously \"#1\" was preferred here, now \"1\" is preferred

Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.getContained().add(org);
patient.setManagingOrganization(new Reference(\"#1\"));
```

Existing code using the previous form of ID (e.g. #1) will continue to work, but will emit
a warning and be automatically corrected by the parser.
