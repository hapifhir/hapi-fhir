type: fix
issue: 2967
backport: 5.5.2
jira: SMILE-2899
title: "Previously, the system would only traverse references to discrete resources while performing a chained search.
This fix adds support for traversing references to contained resources as well, with the limitation that the reference
to the contained resource must be the last reference in the chain."
