    title: "**Breaking Change**:
    The HAPI FHIR Validation infrastructure has changed significantly under the hood. Existing users of the
    validator may need to change package declarations (as FhirInstanceValidator and several other related classes
    have been moved) and potentially add new modules to their Validation Support Chain. See
    [Migrating to HAPI FHIR 5.x](/hapi-fhir/docs/validation/instance_validator.html#migrating-to-hapi-fhir-5x)
    for details on how to account for this change in your code.

     title: "**Breaking Change**:
    The `IFluentPath` interface has been renamed to `IFhirPath`, and the `FhirContext#newFluentPath()` method
    has been replaced with an equivalent `FhirContext.newFhirPath()`. The FhirPath expression language was initially
    called FluentPath before being renamed, so this change brings HAPI FHIR inline with the correct naming.

      title: "The JPA server now shared a single set of tags for all versions of a resource, bringing it in line with the
        functional description in the FHIR specification. This means that it is no longer possible to modify the tags for
        a specific version of a resource, and also causes significant performance improvements in some cases."
