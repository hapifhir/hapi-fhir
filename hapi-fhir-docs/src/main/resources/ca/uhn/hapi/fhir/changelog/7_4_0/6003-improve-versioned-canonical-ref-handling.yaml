title: "When performing a search for a resource which uses versioned canonical
  references to another resource (e.g. a QuestionnaireResponse with a 
  questionnaire reference of `http://example.org/my-questionnaire|1.0`),
  the server failed to process `_include` directives which should bring in
  these references. Includes will now fetch all versions of a canonical
  reference, which is still not perfect but is an improvement over the
  current behaviour. A future update may add more targeted behaviour to
  address including versioned reference targets, but this will require a
  significant re-architecture of the loading module."
