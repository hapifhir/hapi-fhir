title: "In the JPA server, several database columns related to Batch2 jobs and searching
   have been reworked so that they no will longer use LOB datatypes going forward. This
   is a significant advantage on Postgresql databases as it removes a significant use
   of the inefficient `pg_largeobject` table, and should yield performance boosts for
   MSSQL as well."
