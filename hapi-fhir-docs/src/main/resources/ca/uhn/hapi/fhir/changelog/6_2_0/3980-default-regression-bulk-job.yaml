type: fix
issue: 3980
jira: SMILE-5053
backport: 6.1.1
title: "A regression was introduced in 6.1.0 which caused bulk export jobs to not default to the correct output format when the `_outputFormat` parameter was omitted. 
This behaviour has been fixed, and if omitted, will now default to the only legal value `application/fhir+ndjson`."
