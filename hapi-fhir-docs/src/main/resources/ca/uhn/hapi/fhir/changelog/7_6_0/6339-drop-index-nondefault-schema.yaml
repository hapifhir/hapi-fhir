title: "Fixed a bug in migrations when using Postgres when using the non-default schema. If a migration attempted to drop a primary key, the generated SQL would only ever target the `public` schema.
This has been corrected, and the current schema is now used, with `public` as a fallback. Thanks to Adrienne Sox for the contribution!"
