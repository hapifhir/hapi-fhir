type: fix
issue: 6539
title: "Previously, deleting an MDM managed Patient
        could result in errors if:
        * the related Golden record had no other resources linked to it
            (ie, this is the final linked resource)
        * there existed other resources referencing the to-be-deleted resource
        * 'cascade delete` was enabled (to clean up related resources)
        
        This has now been fixed.
