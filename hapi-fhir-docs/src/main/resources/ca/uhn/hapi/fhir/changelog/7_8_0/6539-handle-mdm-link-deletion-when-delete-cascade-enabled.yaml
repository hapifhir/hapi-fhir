title: "Previously, deleting an MDM managed Patient
        could result in errors under certain conditions.
        Particularly, if the related Golden record has no other resources linked to it
        (ie, this is the final linked resource); there exists other resources
        referencing the to-be-deleted resource; and the `cascade delete` option is
        enabled (to clean up related resources).
        
        This has now been fixed.
