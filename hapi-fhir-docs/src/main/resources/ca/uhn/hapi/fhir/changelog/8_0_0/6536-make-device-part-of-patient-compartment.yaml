backport: 7.6.1
title: "The `patient` search parameter for the `Device` resource has been added to the Patient Compartment for the purposes of: 

- AuthorizationInterceptor
- SearchNarrowingInterceptor
- $everything Operation
- Patient/Group Bulk Export

This means that a search for $everything on a patient will return devices associated to this patient. This used to be possible
via the [Advanced Compartment Authorization](/hapi-fhir/docs/security/authorization_interceptor.html#advanced-compartment-authorization), but that would only apply to authorization, 
and not these other use cases. This solution adds this Search Parameter to all places where compartment membership would be checked. 
"
