title: "The HTTP Patch operation now supports the `X-Rewrite-History` header. This enables a specific version of a resource 
to be rewritten in-place without the resource version being incremented by using the PATCH operation. 
See [Patch with History Rewrite](/hapi-fhir/docs/server_plain/rest_operations.html#patch-with-history-rewrite) for more information."
