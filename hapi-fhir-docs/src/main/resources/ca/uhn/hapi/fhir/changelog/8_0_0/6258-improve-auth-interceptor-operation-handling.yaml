type: fix
issue: 6258
title: "The AuthorizationInterceptor handling for operations has been improved
  so that operation rules now directly test the contents of response Bundle
  or Parameters objects returned by the operation when configure to require
  explicit response authorization. This fixes a regression in 7.4.0 where
  operation responses could sometimes be denied even if appropriate
  permissions were granted to view resources in a response bundle. Thanks to
  Gijsbert van den Brink for reporting the issue with a sample test!"
