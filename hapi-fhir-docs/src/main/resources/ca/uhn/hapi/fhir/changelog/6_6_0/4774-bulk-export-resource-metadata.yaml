title: "Bulk Export now supports a new `_exportId` parameter. If provided, any Binary resources generated by this export will have an extension in their `binary.meta` field which identifies this export. This can be used to correlate exported resources with the export job that generated them. 
In addition, the `binary.meta` field of Bulk Export-generated binaries will also contain the job ID of the export job that generated them, as well as the resource type of the data contained within the binary."
