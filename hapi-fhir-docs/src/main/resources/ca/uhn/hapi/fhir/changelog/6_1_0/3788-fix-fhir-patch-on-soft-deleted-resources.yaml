type: fix
issue: 3788
jira: SMILE-4321
title: "Previously, if a FHIR patch was performed on a soft deleted resource, the patch was successfully applied 
and the resource was undeleted and populated with only the data contained in the patch. This has been fixed 
so that patch on deleted resources now issues a HTTP 410 response."
