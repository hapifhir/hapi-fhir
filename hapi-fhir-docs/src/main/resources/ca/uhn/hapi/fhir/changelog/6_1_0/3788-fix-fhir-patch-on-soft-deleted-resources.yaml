jira: SMILE-4321
title: "Previously, if a FHIR patch is performed on a soft deleted resource, the patch is successfully applied 
and the resource becomes undeleted and is populated with only the data contained in the patch. This has been fixed 
so that patch on deleted resources now issues a HTTP 410 response."
