type: fix
issue: 4022
backport: 6.1.2
title: "Fixed a bug in Group Bulk Export:  If a group member was part of multiple groups , it was causing other groups to be included during Group Bulk Export, if the Group resource type was specified. Now, when
doing an export on a specific group, and you elect to return Group resources, only the called Group will be returned, regardless of cross-membership."
