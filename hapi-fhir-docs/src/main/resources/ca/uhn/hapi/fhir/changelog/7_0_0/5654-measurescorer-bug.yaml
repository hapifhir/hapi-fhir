type: fix
issue: 5654
title: "Fixed a MeasureReport measureScoring bug impacting any measures currently using denominator-exception population will 
incorrectly calculate the score without following specification. This bug adds an extension to MeasureReport Groups to capture calculated denominator and
numerator to bring transparency to the measureScore calculation and act as a dataSource of measureScore instead of behind the scenes calculations."
