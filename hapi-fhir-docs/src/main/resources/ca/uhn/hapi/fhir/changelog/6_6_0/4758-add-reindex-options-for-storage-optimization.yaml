title: "The $reindex operation now supports several new optional parameters. 'optimizeStorage' can
   be used to migrate data to/from inline storage mode, and `optimisticLock` can be used to
   control whether to guard against concurrent data modification during reindexing. 
   `reindexSearchParameters` can be used to contron whether search parameters are
   reindexed."
