title: "There was previously a bug in content-type negotiation when reading Binary resources. Previously, if a client requested a Binary and used an `Accept` 
header that matched the Binary resource's `contentType`, the server would return an XML representation of the Binary resource. This has been fixed, and using a matching `Accept` header will cause
the Binary's data to be returned directly in the requested content type."
