type: fix
issue: 6810
title: "A bug in the snapshot generator prevented the automatic generation of StructureDefinition snapshots
   from differential profiles specifically for FHIR R5 StructureDefinitions, which could prevent successful
   validation when using these profiles against R5 resources. This has been corrected."
