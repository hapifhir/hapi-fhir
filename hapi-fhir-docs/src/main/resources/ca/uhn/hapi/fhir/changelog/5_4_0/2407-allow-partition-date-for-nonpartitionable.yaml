title: "When using the JPA server in partitioned mode with a partition interceptor, the interceptor is now called even for
   resource types that can not be placed in a non-default partition (e.g. SearchParameter, CodeSystem, etc.). The interceptor
   may return null or default in this case, but can include a non-null partition date if needed."
