title: "A new interceptor called `UserRequestRetryVersionConflictsInterceptor` has been added to the JPA server. This interceptor
   allows clients to instruct the server to attempt to avoid returning an HTTP 409 (Version Conflict) if two concurrent client 
   requests try to update the same resource at the same time."
