title: "A new extension has been created for use on SearchParameter resources in the JPA server. This extension causes
   a SearchParameter to be indexed, but to not be available for use in searches. This can be set when a new SP is created
   in order to prevent it from being used before an index has been completed. See
   [Introducing Search Parameters on Existing Data](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_standard/fhir_search_custom_search_parameters.html) for more information."
