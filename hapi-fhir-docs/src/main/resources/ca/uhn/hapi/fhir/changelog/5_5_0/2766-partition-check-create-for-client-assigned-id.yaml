issue: 2766
title: "When operating in partitioned mode, the interceptor pointcut `STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_CREATE` will now be invoked
   to determine the partition to use for create with client-assigned IDs. Previously the `STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_READ`
   pointcut was invoked, which was confusing and potentially unexpected."
