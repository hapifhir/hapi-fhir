type: fix
issue: 5731
title: "Previously, transactions that had entries with `Bundle` requests failed with 
`HAPI-0339: Can not handle transaction with nested resource of type Bundle`. This has 
been fixed and now transactions are permitted that contain entries with Bundle requests 
that have a specified url (i.e. `POST` to `/Bundle`), but are rejected if no url is specified 
(i.e. nested transactions or batches)."
