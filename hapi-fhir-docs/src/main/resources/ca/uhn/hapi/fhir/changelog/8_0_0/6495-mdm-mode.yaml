title: "A new MdmSettings mode field was added (default value `MATCH_AND_LINK`). When the MdmSettings mode is set to
`MATCH_ONLY` mode, then MDM operations are disabled and no MDM processing occurs. This is useful if, for example,
you want to use the Patient/$match operation without having the overhead of creating links and golden resources."
