title: "A new configuration option has been added to ParserOptions called `setAutoContainReferenceTargetsWithNoId`. This
   setting disables the automatic creation of contained resources in cases where the target/contained resource is set
   to a Reference instance but not actually added to the `Resource.contained` list. Disabling this automatic containing
   yields a minor performance improvement in systems that do not need this functionality."
