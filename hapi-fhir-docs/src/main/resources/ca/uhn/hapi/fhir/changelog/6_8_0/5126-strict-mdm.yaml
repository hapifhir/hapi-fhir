title: "Previously, when running with mdm, the server automatically changed storage settings to enable
 message subscriptions.  This has been changed to require the user to explicitly enable message subscriptions
 when running with mdm.  If mdm is enabled and message subscriptions are not enabled, the server will now throw
 an exception on startup."
