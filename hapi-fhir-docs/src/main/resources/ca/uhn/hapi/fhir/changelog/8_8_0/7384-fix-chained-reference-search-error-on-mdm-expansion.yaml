type: fix
issue: 7384
jira: SMILE-11171
title: "Previously, chained reference searches by users with `FHIR_AUTO_MDM` could cause a 500 resource not known error. 
This fix runs those searches without MDM expansion so they return correct results. If a chained search explicitly 
includes the `:mdm` modifier, the request is invalid and the server now returns a 400 Bad Request."
