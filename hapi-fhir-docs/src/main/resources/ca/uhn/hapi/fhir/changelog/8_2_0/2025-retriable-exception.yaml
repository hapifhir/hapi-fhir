issue: 6658
title: "Added PessimisticLockException to the list of exceptions that can be retried by the HapiTransactionService.
H2 throws this exception when ensuring Primary Key uniqueness. Without a retry, concurrent transaction processing
could result in deadlock while enforcing uniqueness on HFJ_RES_SEARCH_URL."
