type: fix
issue: 1842
title: "When performing queries with multiple chained search parameters, such as 'Observation?subject.identifier=FOO&specimen.identifier=BAR',
   an unnecessary SQL join was introduced into the resulting query. This was inefficient, and made it particularly hard for the RDBMS optimizer
   to pick an efficient query plan in some cases. This is not fixing a regression (this issue has always existed in HAPI FHIR JPA) but it
   was deemed sufficiently important to merit a dedicated point release."
