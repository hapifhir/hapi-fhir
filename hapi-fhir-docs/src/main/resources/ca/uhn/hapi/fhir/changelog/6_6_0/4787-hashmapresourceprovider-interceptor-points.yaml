issue: 4787
title: "HashMapResourceProvider invoked the `STORAGE_PRESTORAGE_xxx` and
    `STORAGE_PRECOMMIT_xxx` pointcuts after storing the resource into memory. This
    means that if any interceptors threw an exception in an attempt to abort the
    transaction, this did not actually result in the resource storage being aborted.
    This has been corrected."
