title: "The JPA server maintains a cache of active SearchParameeter resources that can cause misleading results
  if a SearchParameter is changed and other resources that would be indexed by the changed SearchParameter are updated
  before the cache refreshes. A new interceptor has been added that should force a refresh sooner, especially on 
  non-clustered systems."
