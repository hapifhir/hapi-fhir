type: fix
issue: 6849
jira: SMILE-9611
title: "Previously, performing a FHIR chained search with the `_count` parameter could cause the search to time out 
when several specific conditions were met:
<ul>
<li>the result contains multiple pages</li>
<li>the result contains mix of resources that have a single reference and have multiple references</li>
<li>the total number of resource references exceeds internal pre-fetch thresholds</li>
</ul>
This has now been fixed. Please see the [Github issue](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/6849) for more 
details on the precise conditions that could cause timeouts."
