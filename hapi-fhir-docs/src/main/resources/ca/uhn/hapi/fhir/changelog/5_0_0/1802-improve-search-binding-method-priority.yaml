title: "In a plain server, if a Resource Provider class had two methods with the same parameter names
  (as specified in the @OptionalParam or @RequiredParam) but different cardinalities, the server could
  sometimes pick the incorrect method to execute. The selection algorithm has been improved to no longer
  have this issue, and to be more consistent and predictable in terms of which resource provider
  method is selected when the choice is somewhat ambiguous."
