title: "When a Bulk Export job runs with a large amount of data,
      there is a chance the reduction step can be kicked off multiple
      times, resulting in data loss in the final report.
      Jobs will now be set to in-progress before processing to
      prevent multiple reduction steps from being started.
   "
