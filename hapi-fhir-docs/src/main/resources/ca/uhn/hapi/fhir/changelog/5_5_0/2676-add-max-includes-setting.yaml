backport: 5.4.1
title: "A new setting has been added to the DaoConfig that allows the maximum number of
  `_include` and `_revinclude` resources to be added to a single search page result. In addition, the
  include/revinclue processor have been redesigned to avoid accidentally overloading the server if
  an include/revinclude would return unexpected massive amounts of data."
