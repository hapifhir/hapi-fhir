title: "The code which detects whether a reference SearchParameter could potentially
   target a CanonicalReference (as opposed to only a standard reference) has been
   improved. This should result in fewer `_include` and `_revinclude` queries being
   processed with an additional canonical lookup, improving speed in these cases."
