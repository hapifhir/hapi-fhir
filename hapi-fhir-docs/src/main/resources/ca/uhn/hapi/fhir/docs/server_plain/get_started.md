# Getting Started with HAPI FHIR Plain Server

Two starter projects are maintained as examples that can be used as a base for a HAPI FHIR Plain Server project. These examples can be used as a guide by examining them or copying relevant bits into your own project, or they can be used to bootstrap a new project by copying the entire project contents and modifying directly.

* **[hapi-fhirstarters-rest-server-skeleton](https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhirstarters/tree/master/java/hapi-fhirstarters-rest-server-skeleton/)** &ndash; This project is a basic skeleton showing the minimal components necessary in order to get started with HAPI FHIR Plain Server. 

* **[hapi-fhirstarters-simple-server](https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhirstarters/tree/master/java/hapi-fhirstarters-simple-server/)** &ndash; This project is a more complete example containing several example resource providers and an [interceptor](/docs/interceptors/).
