type: fix
issue: 4738
title: "Processing multiple transaction bundles with similar entries
      on different threads would lead to Constraint Violations if
      the entries contained similar unique values.
      This has been fixed at the expense of slowing down the processing
      of similar bundles.
      Non-similar bundles should be unaffected.
