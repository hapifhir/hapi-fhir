title: "Added a pointcut (P2P_MEMBER_MATCH_PRE_HOOK) that is invoked
        after basic parameter validation, but before persisted member-match
        operations have occurred.
        This pointcut takes RequestDetails and a MemberMatchPreHookEvent
        (which contains the patient, coverages, and consent resources)
        object.
    "
