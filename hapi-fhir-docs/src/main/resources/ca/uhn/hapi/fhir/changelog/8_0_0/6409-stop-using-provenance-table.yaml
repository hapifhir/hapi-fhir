title: "The JPA server will no longer use the HFJ_RES_VER_PROV table to store and index values from
    the `Resource.meta.source` element. Beginning in HAPI FHIR 6.8.0 (and Smile CDR 2023.08.R01), a
    new pair of columns have been used to store data for this element, so this change only affects
    data which was stored in HAPI FHIR prior to version 6.8.0 (released August 2023). If you have
    FHIR resources which were stored in a JPA server prior to this version, and you use the
    Resource.meta.source element and/or the `_source` search parameter, you should perform a complete
    reindex of your server to ensure that data is not lost. See the upgrade notes for more information.
