title: "A new optional parameter called `_typePostFetchFilterUrl` has been added to the 
   Bulk Export `$export` 
   operation parameters. This parameter allows filters to be specified that will be applied
   in-memory to the resources after they have been initially fetched by the database. This can
   be used to allow complex filters which only remove small numbers of resources to be
   efficiently applied against large datasets."
