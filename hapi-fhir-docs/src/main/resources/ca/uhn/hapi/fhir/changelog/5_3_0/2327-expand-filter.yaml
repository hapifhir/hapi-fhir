type: fix
issue: 2327
title: "The $expand filter parameter was not matching the ValueSet display value in all cases.  E.g. a ValueSet
with name 'abc def ghi' would match 'abc def' and 'def' but not 'def ghi'.  This has been corrected so the ValueSet
will match the filter if any substring of the ValueSet display value matches the $expand filter."
