title: "Added [EMPI](https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_mdm/mdm.html) functionality, including phonetic
indexing, asynchronous rules-based patient and practitioner matching when resources are created and updated.  A number of
[EMPI Operations](https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_mdm/mdm_operations.html) are provided to
maintain EMPI links (e.g. resolving possible matches and possible duplicates).  Also batch operations
are provided to identify links in existing patients and practitioners, and to 'wipe clean' all EMPI data and re-run
the batch as the empi matching rules are refined."
