title: "Several optimizations have been made to the JPA server transaction processor that should result in
   improved performance, particularly when processing large transaction Bundles, such as transactions
   containing many entries, or transactions containing very large entries:
* An unnecessary SQL UPDATE clause has been removed after it was determined to be redundant
* Automatic generation of IDs for contained resources has been optimized"
