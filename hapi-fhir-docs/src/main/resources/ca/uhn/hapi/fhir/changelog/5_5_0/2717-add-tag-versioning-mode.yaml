title: "A new setting has been added to the DaoConfig called Tag Versioning Mode. This setting controls whether a single collection of
   tags/profiles/security labels is maintained across all versions of a single resource, or whether each version of the
   resource maintains its own independent collection. Previously each version always maintained an independent collection,
   which is useful sometimes, but is often not useful and can affect performance."
