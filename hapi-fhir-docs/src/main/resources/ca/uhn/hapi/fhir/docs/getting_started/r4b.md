# FHIR R4B

FHIR R4B is an unusual FHIR release meant to help certain users take advantage of certain FHIR R5 models and features before the release and adoption of FHIR R5. Functionally, R4B is mainly identical to FHIR R4 but with specific resources backported from R5.

As of HAPI FHIR 6.2.0, this version is now supported. See [FHIR and HAPI FHIR Versions](versions.html) for a complete table of FHIR specification version support in HAPI FHIR software versions.

**Support for FHIR R4B is experimental** and may never be completely implemented. It has not been extensively tested and we are not currently aiming for feature parity with normal FHIR version support.
