title: "A regression in HAPI FHIR 6.4.0 meant that ther JPA server schema migrator ran all tasks
   even when the database was initially empty and the schema was being initialized by script. 
   This did not produce any incorrect results, but did impact the amount of time taken to initialize
   an empty database. This has been corrected."
