issue: 7061
title: "When invoking a FHIR extended operation such as `$validate`, where the
   operation is commonly invoked using an HTTP POST with the resource payload
   in the POST body (as opposed to being embedded in a Parameters resource),
   any parameters on the URL were being ignored. This has been corrected."
