issue: 5988
title: "Previously, when creating a custom SearchParameter for a document Bundle that references an entry resource 
through the composition (e.g. Bundle.entry[0].resource.as(Composition).subject.resolve().as(Patient).identifier), 
the search using that parameter would not return the matching document Bundle resources, despite the fullUrl of the entry matching the composite reference. 
This problem does not exist if the reference match can be done against the entry id. 
However an id is not required so the match should be done against the fullUrl.
This issue has been fixed."
