type: fix
issue: 2006
title: "When updating a resource with links that change, to reduce database operations, hapi-fhir reuses link index records.
    However, all the columns were being properly updated except for the source path column which was accidentally missed and
    continued to hold the previous value.  This resulted in mismatched source paths and values.  This has been corrected."
