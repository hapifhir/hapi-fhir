title: "Package installer overrides SearchParameter with the same code and that include 
    the base resources from the installed SearchParameter. That was resulting in the removal of some
    build-in search parameters that are linked to multiple base resources. 
    This was happening when installing US Core package as an example.
    This change allows the existing SearchParameter to continue to exist with the remaining base resources."
