type: fix
issue: 6372
jira: SMILE-9073
backport: 7.4.5
title: "Searches that combined full-text searching (i.e. `_text` or `_content`)
    with other search parameters could fail to return all results if we encountered
    1600 matches against the full-text index where none of them match the rest of the query.
    This has now been fixed.
