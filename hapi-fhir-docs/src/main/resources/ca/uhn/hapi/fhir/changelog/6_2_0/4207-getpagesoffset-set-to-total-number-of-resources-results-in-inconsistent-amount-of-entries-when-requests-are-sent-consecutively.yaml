type: fix
issue: 4207
title: "Previously to improve performance, if the total number of resources was less than the _getpagesoffset given, it would default to 
         the offset for the last resource available. This would result in one entry being displayed in some requests, especially when they are sent consecutively,
          even when there should be none. This has been fixed."
