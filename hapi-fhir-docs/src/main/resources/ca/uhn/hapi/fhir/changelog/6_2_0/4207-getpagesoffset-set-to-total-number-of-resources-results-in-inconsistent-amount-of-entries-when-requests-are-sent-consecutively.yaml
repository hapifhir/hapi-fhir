type: fix
issue: 4207
title:  "Previously to improve performance, if the total number of resources was less than the _getpageoffset, 
      the results would default to last resource offset. This is especially evident when requests are consecutive 
      resulting in one entry being displayed in some requests. This issue is now fixed."
