type: fix
issue: 7160
title: "Previously, a Patient resource could not be deleted if a `Provenance.target` has a versioned reference to the 
Patient. The delete was prevented by the referential integrity check on delete, even though the versioned references 
are not supposed to prevent deletion. This has now been fixed."
