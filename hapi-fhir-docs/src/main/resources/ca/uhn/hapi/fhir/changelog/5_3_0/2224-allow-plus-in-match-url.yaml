title: "When performing a conditional create/update containing the email search parameter, any `+` characters will now be interpreted
   as actually being a plus symbol instead of being unescaped into a space character. This is technically a deviation from how URLs should
   be parsed, but allows for a sensible behaviour in a spot where no spaces are allowed."
