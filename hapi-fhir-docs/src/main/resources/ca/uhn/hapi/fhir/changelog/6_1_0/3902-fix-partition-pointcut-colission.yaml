title: "
      Fixed bug where creating a new resource in partitioned mode using a PUT operation
      invoked pointcut STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_READ during validation. This caused
      errors because read interceptors (listing on Pointcut.STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_READ)
      and write interceptors (listening on Pointcut.STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_CREATE) could
      return different partitions (say, all vs default).
      Now, only the CREATE pointcut will be invoked, and the same partition will be used
      for any reads during UPDATE.
