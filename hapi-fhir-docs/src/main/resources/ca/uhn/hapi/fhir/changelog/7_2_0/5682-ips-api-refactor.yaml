title: "The IPS $summary generation API has been overhauled to make it more flexible for 
   future use cases. Specifically, the section registry has been removed and folded into
   the generation strategy, and support has been added for non-JPA sources of data. This is
   a breaking change to the API, and implementers will need to update their code. This updated
   API incorporates community feedback, and should now be considered a stable API for IPS
   generation."
