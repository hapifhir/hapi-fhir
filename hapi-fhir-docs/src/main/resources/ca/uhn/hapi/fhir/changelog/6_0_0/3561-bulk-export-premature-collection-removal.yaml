title: "Previously, Bulk export jobs automatically cleared the collection after a hardcoded 2 hour time period from start of the job. This is now configurable via a new DaoConfig property,
`setBulkExportFileRetentionPeriodHours()`. If this is set to a value of 0 or below, then the collections will never be expired."
