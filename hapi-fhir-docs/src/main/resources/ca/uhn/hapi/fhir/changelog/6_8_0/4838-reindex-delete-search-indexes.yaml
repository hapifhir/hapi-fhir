title: "When performing a resource reindex on a deleted resource, any search index rows will now
  be deleted. Deleting a resource should generally not leave any such rows behind, but they can
  be left if the resource is manually deleted using SQL directly against the database and in this
  case the reindex job will now clean up these unwanted rows."
