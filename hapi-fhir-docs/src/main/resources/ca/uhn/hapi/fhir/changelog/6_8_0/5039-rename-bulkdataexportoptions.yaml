type: change
issue: 5039
title: "The class `BulkDataExportOptions` has been removed and replaced with an equivalent class called
   `BulkExportJobParameters`. This change is a breaking change unfortunately, but should be easily remedied
   as the replacement class has a very similar signature. This change reduces a large amount of duplication
   in the bulk export codebase and should make for more maintainable code in the future."
