issue: 3392
title: "When cross-partition reference Mode is used, the rest-hook subscriptions on a partition enabled server would
   cause a NPE. Cause of this is from the reloading of the subscription when the server is restarted.
   This issue has been fixed. Also fixed issue with revinclude for rest-hook subscription not working."
