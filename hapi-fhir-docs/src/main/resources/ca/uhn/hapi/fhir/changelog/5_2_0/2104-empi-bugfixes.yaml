type: fix
issue: 2104
title: "EMPI bug fixes. Special characters in search param values (e.g. space)
led to missed matches; these are now properly escaped so matches are accurately found.
Candidates were failing to match when candidateSearchParams was empty; matches now
work properly with empty candidateSearchParams.  matchResultMap entries were
incorrectly resolving if any named matchFields matched; they now correctly
resolve only when ALL matchFields match."
