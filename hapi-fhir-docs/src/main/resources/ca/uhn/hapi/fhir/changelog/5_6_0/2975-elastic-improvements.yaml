title: "Two improvements have been made to the connection to Elasticsearch. First, null username and password values are now permitted. Second, multiple hosts are now permitted via the `setHosts()` method on the ElasticHibernatePropertiesBuilder, allowing you to
 connect to multiple elasticsearch clusters at once. Thanks to Dušan Marković for the contribution!"
