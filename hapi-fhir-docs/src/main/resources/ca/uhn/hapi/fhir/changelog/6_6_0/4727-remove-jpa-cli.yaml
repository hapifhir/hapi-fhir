title: "The HAPI FHIR CLI `run-server` command has been removed. This command
   was used to launch a HAPI FHIR JPA Server instance. The 
   [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/)
   project has long since duplicated and improved on the CLI version of the 
   launcher, and maintaining both was been a maintenance burden. Users of the
   CLI command are recommended to migrate to the starter project."
