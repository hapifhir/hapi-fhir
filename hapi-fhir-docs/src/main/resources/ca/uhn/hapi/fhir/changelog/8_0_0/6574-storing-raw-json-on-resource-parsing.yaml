title: "The raw json of parsed resources will be kept in the UserData
        (key: `RAW_JSON`) of the resource itself.
        This is to allow consistency in handling validation downstream,
        since otherwise the FhirParser is far more lenient about what
        it can parse than $validate is for what it accepts.
"
