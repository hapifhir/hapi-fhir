title: "When updating or reindexing a resource in the JPA server, if duplicate rows are
   present in the indexing tables, the duplicate rows may fail to be removed. Duplicates
   are not typically present in these tables, but can happen if an indexing job fails in
   some circumstances. The impact of these rows not being cleaned up is that resources
   may appear in search results that they should no longer appear in."
