jira: SMILE-4178
title: "Previously when a `Subscription` was created using the package installer and with partitioning enabled, 
there was an error reading the partition name inside the `SubscriptionRegisteringSubscriber`. This fix checks 
incoming `Subscription` requests for a `RequestPartitionId` with a list of partition names containing null values 
and uses `RequestPartitionId#defaultPartition()` to obtain the default partition instead."
