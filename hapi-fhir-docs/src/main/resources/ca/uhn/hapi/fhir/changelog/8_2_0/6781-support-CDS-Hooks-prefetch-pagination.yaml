title: "CDS Hooks implementation now supports pagination when prefetching data for requests issued to the FHIR server
 for missing prefetch keys. If a prefetch request to a FHIR server returns a paginated bundle, the prefetch service now 
 paginates through the bundle, and collects all the data into a single bundle before passing it on to the CDS Hooks 
 service."
