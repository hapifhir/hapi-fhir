/**
 * Subscription topic notifications are natively supported in R5, R4B.  They are also partially supported and in R4
 * via the subscription backport spec <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/components.html">Subscription Backport</a>.
 * In all versions, it is possible for a FHIR Repository to submit topic subscription notifications triggered by some
 * arbitrary "business event".  In R5 and R4B most subscription topic notifications will be triggered by a SubscriptionTopic
 * match.  However, in the R4 backport, the SubscriptionTopic is not supported and the SubscriptionTopicDispatcher service
 * is provided to generate those notifications instead.  Any custom java extension to the FHIR repository can @Autowire this service to
 * send topic notifications to all Subscription resources subscribed to that topic.
