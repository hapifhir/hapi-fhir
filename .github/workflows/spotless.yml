               Please run `mvn spotless:apply` or `mvn clean install -DskipTests` to fix the formatting issues. 
               
               You can automate this auto-formatting process to execute on the git pre-push hook, by installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and then calling `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`. This will cause formatting to run automatically whenever you push.
