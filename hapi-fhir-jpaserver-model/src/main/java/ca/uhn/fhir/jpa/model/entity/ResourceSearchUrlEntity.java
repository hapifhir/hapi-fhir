/**
 * This entity is used to enforce uniqueness on a given search URL being
 * used as a conditional operation URL, e.g. a conditional create or a
 * conditional update. When we perform a conditional operation that is
 * creating a new resource, we store an entity with the conditional URL
 * in this table. The URL is the PK of the table, so the database
 * ensures that two concurrent threads don't accidentally create two
 * resources with the same conditional URL.
 * <p>
 * Note that this entity is partitioned, but does not always respect the
 * partition ID of the parent resource entity (it may just use a
 * hardcoded partition ID of -1 depending on configuration). As a result
 * we don't have a FK relationship. This table only contains short-lived
 * rows that get cleaned up and purged periodically, so it should never
 * grow terribly large anyhow.
