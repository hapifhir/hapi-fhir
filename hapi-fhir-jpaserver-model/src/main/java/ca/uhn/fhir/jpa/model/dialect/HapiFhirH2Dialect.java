	 * As of Hibernate 6, generated schemas include a column level check constraint that enforces valid values
	 * for columns that back an Enum type. For example, the column definition for {@link ResourceTable#getFhirVersion()}
	 * would look like:
	 * <pre>
	 *  RES_VERSION varchar(7) check (RES_VERSION in ('DSTU2','DSTU2_HL7ORG','DSTU2_1','DSTU3','R4','R4B','R5')),
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * This is a nice addition since it enforces the values that the Enum allows, but it's problematic for us because these
	 * constraints are invisible to the JDBC metadata API on most databases, which means that our schema migration
	 * checker isn't able to catch problems if we add a value to an Enum and don't add a corresponding database
	 * migration. Rather than risk having inconsistent behaviour between annotated and migrated schemas, we just
	 * disable these checks on all of our dialects.
	 * </p><p>
	 * See this discussion from the author of SchemaCrawler discussing this limitation:
	 * <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63346650/schemacrawler-java-api-retrieve-check-column-constraints">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63346650/schemacrawler-java-api-retrieve-check-column-constraints</a>.
	 * With this change in place, the definition above becomes simply:
	 * <pre>
	 *  RES_VERSION varchar(7),
	 * </pre>
