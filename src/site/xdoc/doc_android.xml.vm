			<p>
				HAPI now has a specially built module for use on Android. Android developers
				may use this JAR to take advantage of the FHIR model classes, and the FHIR client (running a FHIR server
				on Android is not yet supported. Get in touch if this is something you are interested in working on!)
			</p>

			<p>
				As of HAPI FHIR 3.1.0, the <code>hapi-fhir-android</code> module has been streamlined in order
				to reduce its footprint. Previous versions of the library included both an XML and a JSON parser
				but this has been streamlined to only include JSON support in order to reduce the number of
				libraries required in an Android build.
			</p>

			<p>
				When using the HAPI FHIR Android client, the client will request only JSON responses
				(via the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header) and will not be able to communicate
				with FHIR servers that support only XML encoding (few, if any, servers actually exist
				with this limitation that we are aware of).
			</p>

			<p>
				The Android client also uses the <code>hapi-fhir-client-okhttp</code> module,
				which is an HTTP client based on the OkHttp library. This library has proven to be
				more powerful and less likely to cause issues on Android than the Apache HttpClient
				implementation which is bundled by default.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that the Android JAR is still new and hasn't received as much testing as other
				parts of the library. We would greatly appreciate feedback, testing, etc. Also note that
				because mobile apps run on less powerful hardware compared to desktop and server applications,
				it is all the more important to keep a single instance of the <code>FhirContext</code>
				around for good performance, since this object is expensive to create. We are hoping to 
				improve performance of the creation of this object in a future release. If you are an
				Android developer and would like to help with this, please get in touch!

				<p>
					To add the HAPI library via Gradle, you should add the
					<a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Chapi-fhir-android">hapi-fhir-android</a>
					library to your Gradle file, as well as a structures library for the appropriate
					version of FHIR that you want to support, e.g.
					<a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Chapi-fhir-structures">hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3</a>.
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[dependencies {
                                 compile "ca.uhn.hapi.fhir:hapi-fhir-android:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
                                 compile "ca.uhn.hapi.fhir:hapi-fhir-structures-dstu2:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
}]]></source>

				<p>
					Uou will also need to manually exclude the Woodstox StAX library from
					inclusion, as this library uses namespaces which are prohibited on Android. You should also
					exclude
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[configurations {
  all*.exclude group: 'org.codehaus.woodstox'
  all*.exclude group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents'
  }]]></source>

					To see a sample Gradle file for a working Android project
					using HAPI FHIR, see the

		<section name="Performance">
			<p>
				On mobile devices, performance problems are particularly noticeable. This
				is made worse by the fact that some economy Android devices have much slower performance
				than modern desktop computers. See the
				<a href="./doc_rest_client_http_config.html#performance">Client Configuration Performance</a>
				page for some tips on how to improve client performance.

				The following is intended to be a selection of publicly available open source
				Android applications which use HAPI FHIR and might be useful as a reference.
