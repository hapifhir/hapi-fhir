		<section name="Resource References">
			
			<p>
				Resource references are a key part of the HAPI FHIR model, 
				since almost any resource will have references to other resources
				within it.
			</p>			
			
			<p>
				The <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/dstu/composite/ResourceReferenceDt.html">ResourceReferenceDt</a>
				type is the datatype for references. This datatype has a number of properties which help 
				make working with FHIR simple.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The <code>getReference()</code> method returns an IdDt instance which contains the identity of the
				resource being referenced. This is the item which is most commonly populated when
				interacting with FHIR. For example, consider the following Patient resource, which 
				contains a reference to an Organization resource: 
			</p>
			<source><![CDATA[<Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
   <identifier>
      <system value="urn:mrns"/>
      <value value="253345"/>
   </identifier>
   <managingOrganization>
      <reference value="Organization/112"/>
   </managingOrganization>
</Patient>]]></source>
			
			<p>
				Given a Patient resource obtained by invoking a client operation, a call to 
				<code>IdDt ref = patient.getManagingOrganization().getReference();</code>
				returns an instance of IdDt which contains the "Organization/112" reference.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ResourceReferenceDt also has a field for storing actual resource instances however,
				and this can be very useful.
			</p>
			

		</section>

		<section name="References in Client Code">
		
			<p>
				In client code, if a resource reference refers to a resource which was received as a
				part of the same response, <code>getResource()</code> will be populated with the 
				actual resource. This can happen because either the resource was received as a 
				contained resource, or the resource was received as a separate resource in a bundle.
			</p>
			
		</section>

		<section name="References in Server Code">
		
			<p>
				In server code, you will often want to return a resource which contains
				a link to another resource. Generally these "linked" resources are
				not actually included in the response, but rather a link to the
				resource is included and the client may request that resource directly
				(by ID) if it is needed.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following example shows a Patient resource being created which will have a
				link to its managing organization when encoded from a server:
			</p>
			<source><![CDATA[Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.setId("Patient/1333");
patient.addIdentifier("urn:mrns", "253345");
patient.getManagingOrganization().setReference("Organization/124362");]]></source>
			
			<subsection name="Handling Includes (_include) in a Bundle">
				
				<p>
					Your server code may also wish to add additional resource to a bundle
					being returned (e.g. because of an _include directive in the client's request).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To do this, you can implement your server method to simply return 
					<code>List&lt;IResource&gt;</code> and then simply add your extra resources to
					the list. Another technique however, is to populate the reference as shown
					in the example below, but ensure that the referenced resource has an ID set.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					In the following example, the Organization resource has an ID set, so it will not
					be contained but will rather appear as a distinct entry in any returned
					bundles. Both resources are added to a bundle, which will then have
					two entries:
				</p>
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="addIncludes" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/IncludesExamples.java" />
				</macro>
		
				<p>
					This will give the following output:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[<Bundle xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
   <id value="4e151274-2b19-4930-97f2-8427167a176c"/>
   <type value="searchset"/>
   <total value="1"/>
   <link>
      <relation value="fhir-base"/>
      <url value="http://example.com/base"/>
   </link>
   <link>
      <relation value="self"/>
      <url value="http://example.com/base/Patient"/>
   </link>
   <entry>
      <resource>
         <Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
            <id value="1333"/>
            <identifier>
               <system value="urn:mrns"/>
               <value value="253345"/>
            </identifier>
            <managingOrganization>
               <reference value="Organization/65546"/>
            </managingOrganization>
         </Patient>
      </resource>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <resource>
         <Organization xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
            <id value="65546"/>
            <name value="Test Organization"/>
         </Organization>
      </resource>
      <search>
         <mode value="include"/>
      </search>
   </entry>
</Bundle>
]]></source>

			<subsection name="Contained Resources">
				
				<p>
					On the other hand, if the linked resource
					does not have an ID set, the linked resource will
					be included in the returned bundle as a "contained" resource. In this
					case, HAPI itself will define a local reference ID (e.g. "#1").
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[// Create an organization, note that the organization does not have an ID
Organization org = new Organization();
org.getName().setValue("Contained Test Organization");

// Create a patient
Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.setId("Patient/1333");
patient.addIdentifier("urn:mrns", "253345");

// Put the organization as a reference in the patient resource
patient.getManagingOrganization().setResource(org);

String encoded = ourCtx.newXmlParser().setPrettyPrint(true).encodeResourceToString(patient);
System.out.println(encoded);]]></source>
				
				<p>
					This will give the following output:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[<Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
   <contained>
      <Organization xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir" id="1">
         <name value="Contained Test Organization"/>
      </Organization>
   </contained>
   <identifier>
      <system value="urn:mrns"/>
      <value value="253345"/>
   </identifier>
   <managingOrganization>
      <reference value="#1"/>
   </managingOrganization>
</Patient>]]></source>
				
			</subsection>
			
			<p>
				Note that you may also "contain" resources manually in your own code if you 
				prefer. The following example show how to do this:
			</p>
			<macro name="snippet">
				<param name="id" value="manualContained" />
				<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/ResourceRefs.java" />
			</macro>
						
						
						
		</section>
		
		<section name="Versioned References">
		
			<p>
				By default, HAPI will strip resource versions from references between resources.
				For example, if you set a reference to <code>Patient.managingOrganization</code>
				to the value <code>Patient/123/_history/2</code>, HAPI will encode this
				reference as <code>Patient/123</code>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is because in most circumstances, references between resources should be
				versionless (e.g. the reference just points to the latest version, whatever 
				version that might be).
			</p>
			<p>
				There are valid circumstances however for wanting versioned references. If you 
				need HAPI to emit versionned references, you have a few options:
			</p>
			<p>
				You can force the parser to never strip versions:
			</p>
			<macro name="snippet">
				<param name="id" value="disableStripVersions" />
				<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/Parser.java" />
			</macro>
			<p>
				You can also disable this behaviour entirely on the context (so that it
				will apply to all parsers):
			</p>
			<macro name="snippet">
				<param name="id" value="disableStripVersionsCtx" />
				<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/Parser.java" />
			</macro>
			<p>
				You can also configure HAPI to not strip versions only on certain fields. This
				is desirable if you want versionless references in most places but need them
				in some places:
			</p>
			<macro name="snippet">
				<param name="id" value="disableStripVersionsField" />
				<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/Parser.java" />
			</macro>
