				<b>Nov 12, 2018 - HAPI FHIR 3.6.0 (Food) Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings us back to our regular 3 month release cycle (although we're
				only two months after the last release, which was delayed more than we were hoping).
				This also marks the beginning of codenamed major releases. Our first codename
				is Food, and we will be following the popular (and admittedly unoriginal) strategy
				of using the next letter in the alphabet for each release.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, see the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list
				of changes. Notable changes include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The FHIR R4 structures have been upgraded to the latest (3.6.0) version of the structures.
					This marks an exciting (but pointless) milestone that HAPI FHIR and FHIR itself have the
					same version number!
				</li>
				<li>
					The JPA Server migrator tool has been enhanced so that it is now possible
					to run a rolling migration from 3.4.0 to 3.6.0 instead of needing to incur
					a long downtime while the indexes are rebuilt. See <a href="http://hapifhir.io/doc_jpa.html#Migrating_340_to_350">this link</a> for details. In addition, the migrator can now migrate
					HAPI FHIR 3.3.0 as well. This tool now also operates in a multithreaded way,
					meaning that it can run migrations much faster in systems with a lot of data.
				</li>
				<li>
					A new custom FHIR operation has been added, allowing subscriptions to be manually
					triggered/retriggered. This means that it is possible to cause a subscription
					to process a resource in the database as though that resource had been updated,
					without actually updating it.
				</li>
				<li>
					The JPA SearchCoordinator now pre-fetches only the first few pages of a search
					by default instead of pre-fetching all possible results. This makes searches
					dramatically more efficient in servers where users commonly perform searches
					that could potentially return many pages but only actually load the first few.
				</li>
				<li>
					A new JPA sample project has been added. This sample has existed for a while, but
					this is now the offical "reference" project for anyone looking to get started with
					HAPI FHIR JPA.
				</li>
			</ul>

				<b>Sep 17, 2018 - HAPI FHIR 3.5.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release is happening a little bit later than we had hoped. This release features
				a complete reworking of the way that search indexes in the JPA server work, as well
				as a new database migration tool that can be used to migrate to a new version of
				HAPI FHIR. Testing these features ended up taking longer than we had hoped, but
				we think it will be worth the wait.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, see the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list
				of changes. Notable changes include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					HAPI FHIR now works correctly and is tested on Java 9 and 10, and continues
					to support Java 8. Java 9 introduces a new module system that meant a lot of
					additional testing and build tweaks were required in order to get HAPI FHIR
					working on that platform. Future migrations do not look like they will be
					as difficult, and we anticipate supporting current release versions of Java
					as they come out.
				</li>
				<li>
					A new database migration tool has been added to the HAPI FHIR CLI. This tool
					allows administrators to automatically upgrade an existing database schema from
					a previous version of HAPI FHIR (currently only HAPI FHIR 3.4.0 is supported)
					to the latest version. See the
					<a href="http://hapifhir.io/doc_cli.html#migrate-database">command documentation</a>
					for more information.
				</li>
				<li>
					The JPA server mechanism for indexing resources has been completely reworked to
					index based on complex hashes of data. This change should have no user-visible
					effects, but it does reduce the total size of the database and improve search
					performance in many cases. It also lays the groundwork for some other features we have
					planned, including native JPA server multitenancy and column-level encryption.
				</li>
				<li>
					Performance in the JPA server has been significantly improved when fetching large
					pages of data (e.g. search results or history operations containing 100+
					resources in one page). This work comes thanks to a collaboration between
					HAPI FHIR and the US National Institutes for Health (NIH).
				</li>
				<li>
					Support for LOINC has been further improved, thanks to an ongoing collaboration
					between HAPI FHIR and the Regenstrief Institute.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note that this version does <b>not</b> include an updated set of FHIR R4 resources. The
				previous versions are still included. This is because the latest resources have a number 
				of changes that break the HAPI FHIR build in fairly fundamental ways (e.g. compartment
				definitions have changes to using a FHIRPath expression that requires a resource resolution,
				a new validation rule has been added to require narratives across the board, etc.). Work is
				ongoing on addressing these changes, but as a result we decided to not delay the
				release any further. A point release should be available soon with updated definitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!

				<b>May 28, 2018 - HAPI FHIR 3.4.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings lots of fixes and some significant enhancements. See the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list
				of changes. Notable changes include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					HAPI FHIR now supports and requires JDK 8. Support for JDK 7 and below has
					officially been dropped.
				</li>
				<li>
					The R4 draft structures have been updated to the latest versions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Support for LOINC has been significantly improved thanks to a collaboration
					between the HAPI FHIR project and the Regenstrief Institute. The HAPI FHIR
					terminology service now imports LOINC parts, ValueSets, ConceptMaps, and all
					related artifacts.
				</li>
				<li>
					Support for the ConceptMap <![CDATA[<code>$translate</code>]]> method has been
					implemented, meaning that the terminology service now covers validation as well
					as translation use cases. Further enhancements are planned. A utility has also
					been added to the HAPI FHIR CLI for importing and exporting ConceptMaps as
					CSV files for external editing.
				</li>
				<li>
					Several index table enhancements have been made to the JPA server schema in
					anticipation of future changes that will improve performance and decrease index
					sizes. These enhancements consist of new columns that have been added and will be
					populated in HAPI FHIR 3.4.0 but will not actually be used until HAPI FHIR 3.5.0.
					Please see the changelog for an upgrade script that should be run.
				</li>
				<li>
					The HAPI FHIR CLI is now available for OSX users using Homebrew.
				</li>
				<li>
					The validation framework has been further harmonized so that DSTU2 resources
					will now also share the harmonized DSTU3/R4 validation codebase. This
					has resulted in a significantly more accurate validator
					for DSTU2 resources.
				</li>
				<li>
					A number of other enhancements have also been made, as well as several significant
					bugfixes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!

				<b>Mar 29, 2018 - HAPI FHIR 3.3.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings logs of fixes and some significant enhancements.See the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list
				of changes. Notable changes include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A schema change to the JPA server has been made which will result in
					significantly less storage space being used and better write performance
					for repositories which contain a large number of resource, or larger
					resource bodies. Prior to this change, resource bodies were stored in
					duplicate in two places in the database and this has now been corrected.
					<br/><br/>
					Note that a database migration script must be run for this upgrade, see
					the changelog for details.
				</li>
				<li>
					The validator has been refactored to use a single codebase across DSTU3/R4
					validation which means that any fixes and enhancements will now affect both.
					This makes the DSTU3 validator much more complete in terms of support for
					advanced validation as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Several significant features were contributed by the community, including
					native OSGi support (several HAPI FHIR JARs now have OSGi metadata included)
					as well as initial experimental support for ElasticSearch instead of
					Raw Lucene for the JPA server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Several enhancements and bugfixes have been made to the interceptor
					framework.
				</li>
				<li>
					Many other bugfixes and enhancements have been made as well
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note also that we are hiring! If you have an interest in helping us develop
				HAPI FHIR or work on implementation projects, please

				<b>Jan 13, 2018 - HAPI FHIR 3.2.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a fairly light release, with only a small number of
				new features, and a few bugfixes. See the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list
				of changes.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Support for using SearchParameter resources to define custom parameters
					in the JPA server has been backported to DSTU2, meaning that DSTU2 servers
					can now user this functionality (previously only DSTU3/R4 supported this)
				</li>
				<li>
					Several tweaks and enhancements to the server interceptor framework
					have been added
				</li>
				<li>
					Multitenancy support has been added to the server framework (note that
					this is only the plain server framework at this point, not the JPA
					server)
				</li>
				<li>
					The R4 structures have been synced to the latest definitions in

				<b>November 23, 2017 - HAPI FHIR 3.1.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings several interesting things:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Support for Android has been restored, and improved while we're at it! The use of a special "uberjar" with its own classifier is no longer required, <code>hapi-fhir-android</code> works as a normal Gradle dependency in your Android build. See the <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-android-integration-test">HAPI FHIR  Android Integration Test</a> for an example.</li>
				<li>Support for the <code>Cache-Control</code> header has been added for JPA server searches, allowing a client to request that cached results not be used.</li>
				<li>A number of bugs were fixed and performance improvements were made (see the <a href="http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html">changelog</a> for a full list)</li>
				<li>Spring has been upgraded to the 5.0 series.</li>
				<li>Some initial refactoring has occurred towards enabling ElasticSearch support in JPA server. Note that any existing JPA projects will need to add an additional property in their Spring config called <code>hibernate.search.model_mapping</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-example/src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/demo/FhirServerConfig.java#L84">this line</a> in the example project.</li>
				<li>Support for Spring Boot has been added to many of the modules of the libaray. See the <a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-spring-boot/hapi-fhir-spring-boot-samples">Spring Boot Samples</a> for examples of how to use this.</li>

				<b>Sep 27, 2017 - HAPI FHIR 3.0.0 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a massive release, and includes a huge number of enhancements,
				fixes, and new features. Unfotunately it also brings a few breaking API changes
				so we are calling it version 3.0.0 (we are also moving to SemVer versioning).
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a> has the full list
				of changes in this release. I am outlining a few of the important ones here:
			</p>
			<p><b>FHIR R4 and DSTU1 Support</b></p>
			<p>
				Support for FHIR R4 (current working draft) has been <b>added</b>
				(in a new module called <code>hapi-fhir-structures-r4</code>)
				and
				support for FHIR DSTU1 (<code>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu</code>)
				has been <b>removed</b>. Removing support for the legacy
				DSTU1 FHIR version was a difficult decision, but it allows us the
				opportunitity to clean up the codebase quite a bit, and remove some
				confusing legacy parts of the API (such as the legacy Atom Bundle class).
				<br/><br/>
				A new redesigned table of HAPI FHIR versions to FHIR version support has been
				added to the <a href="http://hapifhir.io/download.html">Download Page</a>
			</p>
			<p><b>Module Restructuring</b></p>
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR's modules have been restructured for more consistency and less coupling
				between unrelated parts of the API.
				<br/><br/>
				A new complete list of HAPI FHIR modules has been added to the
				<a href="http://hapifhir.io/download.html">Download Page</a>. Key changes
				include:

				<ul>
					<li>
						HAPI FHIR's <b>client</b> codebase has been moved out of <code>hapi-fhir-base</code>
						and in to a new module called <code>hapi-fhir-client</code>. Client users now need
						to explicitly add this JAR to their project (and non-client users now no longer
						need to depend on it)
					</li>
					<li>
						HAPI FHIR's <b>server</b> codebase has been moved out of <code>hapi-fhir-base</code>
						and in to a new module called <code>hapi-fhir-server</code>. Server users now need
						to explicitly add this JAR to their project (and non-server users now no longer
						need to depend on it)
					</li>
					<li>
						As a result of the client and server changes above, we no longer need to produce
						a special Android JAR which contains the client, server (which added space but was
						not used) and structures. There is now a normal module called <code>hapi-fhir-android</code>
						which is added to your Android Gradle file along with whatever structures JARs you
						wish to add. See the
						<a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-android-integration-test">Android Integration Test</a>
						to see a sample project using HAPI FHIR 3.0.0. <b>Note that this has been reported to
						work by some people but others are having issues with it!</b> In order to avoid delaying
						this release any further we are releasing now despite these issues. If you are an Android
						guru and want to help iron things out please get in touch. If not, it might be a good
						idea to stay on HAPI FHIR 2.5 until the next point release of the 3.x series.
					</li>
					<li>
						A new JAR containing FHIR utilities called <code>hapi-fhir-utilities</code> has been
						added. This JAR reflects the ongoing harmonization between HAPI FHIR and the FHIR
						RI codebases and is generally required in order to use HAPI at this point (if you
						are using a dependency manager such as Maven or Gradle it will be brought in to your
						project automatically as a dependency)
					</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<p><b>Package Changes</b></p>
			<p>
				In order to allow the reoganizations and decoupling above to happen, a number of important classes
				and interfaces have been moved to new packages. A sample list of these changes is listed
				below. When upgrading to 3.0.0 your project may well show a number of compile errors
				related to missing classes. In most cases this can be resolved by simply removing the HAPI
				imports from your classes and asking your IDE to "Organize Imports" once again. This is an
				annoying change we do realize, but it is neccesary in order to allow the project to
				continue to grow.

				<ul>
					<li>IGenericClient moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client.api</li>
					<li>IRestfulClient moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client.api</li>
					<li>AddProfileTagEnum moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.context.api</li>
					<li>IVersionSpecificBundleFactory moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.context.api</li>
					<li>BundleInclusionRule moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.context.api</li>
					<li>RestSearchParameterTypeEnum moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.api</li>
					<li>EncodingEnum moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.api</li>
					<li>Constants moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.api</li>
					<li>IClientInterceptor moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client.api</li>
					<li>ITestingUiClientFactory moved from package ca.uhn.fhir.util to package ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server.util</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<p><b>Fluent Client Search Change</b></p>
			<p>
				Because the Atom-based DSTU1 Bundle class has been removed from the library, users of the
				HAPI FHIR client must now always include a Bundle return type in search calls. For example,
				the following call would have worked previously:

				<pre>
					Bundle bundle = client.search().forResource(Patient.class)
					.where(new TokenClientParam("gender").exactly().code("unknown"))
					.prettyPrint()
					.execute();
				</pre>

				This now needs an explicit returnBundle statement, as follows:

				<pre>
					Bundle bundle = client.search().forResource(Patient.class)
					.where(new TokenClientParam("gender").exactly().code("unknown"))
					.prettyPrint()
					.returnBundle(Bundle.class)
					.execute();
				</pre>

			</p>

				<b>June 8, 2017 - HAPI FHIR 2.5 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings number of bugfixes and improvements. Most importantly
				for many users, this release brings a significant performance enhacement
				to the JPA server for searches. Essentially our search module has been
				rewritten to stream results back to the client as soon as they
				become available, and to reuse previous cached search results for a period of time.
				This cacheing behaviour in the JPA server is important to consider,
				since it does mean that	your clients can see stale search results for
				a short period of time under some circumstances. The default cache period
				is 1 minute, but this can be changed or even disabled through configuration.

				We were later than we would have liked in delivering this release, as we
				are focusing heavily on performance improvements in the JPA module. We
				were hoping to have our performance branch merged in time for this release,
				but it needs a bit more time to stabilize. We will be releasing the initial
				snapshot builds of HAPI FHIR 2.5-SNAPSHOT immediately following this
				release. Please try these out if you want to test the JPA module with
				significant performance improvements when searching large datasets, or
				under heavy load.

				<b>November 11, 2016 - HAPI FHIR 2.1 Released</b> -
				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings several primary changes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						STU3 definitions have been updated to the
						latest definitions (FHIR 1.7.0 - SVN 10129)
					</li>
					<li>
						Add support for FHIR Patch operation (thanks to
						Peter Girard of McKesson for his help on this!)
					</li>
					<li>
						Android library has been streamlined to use the
						OkHttp client by default (no more fighting with
						out-of-date Apache HttpClient. Thanks to Matt Clarke of Orion Health
						for his help on this!)
					</li>
					<li>
						The STU3 client now supports both the Conformance resource
						(which is going away) and the new CapabilityStatement
						(which replaces it). This should allow for a bridge
						while servers are migrated to the new resource type
						being returned by the <![CDATA[<code>/metadata</code>]]> endpoint.

				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
				GitHub's releases section.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release brings several primary changes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The JSON parser used by HAPI's parser module has been switched
						from <a href="https://jsonp.java.net/">JSR353/JSONP</a> to
						<a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Google GSON</a>. This
						should be an invisible change for most users (the only thing that
						broke for us was that a few extra spaces are inserted in pretty-printed
						encoding and this broke some overly sensitive unit tests). Gson is
						a much more active project than JSONP and should be better
						supported in the future.
					</li>
					<li>
						STU3 definitions have been updated to the FHIR 1.6.0
						2016 September Ballot Candidate definitions
						 (aka the 2016 Baltimore Connectathon version).
					</li>
					<li>
						Content-Types emitted by the library have been updated to use
						the new content type strings proposed for use as of STU3 (when using
						HAPI in STU3 mode). E.g. <code>application/fhir+xml</code> insead
						of the previous <code>application/xml+fhir</code>

				Also, a few quick community notes:
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>On DSTU3 naming:</b> FMG has decided to rename the upcoming FHIR <code>DSTU3</code> (draft standard
				for trial use)	release to <code>STU3</code> (standard for trial use). In order to avoid breaking
				existing software, we will <b>NOT</b> be renaming the <code>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3</code> module
				of HAPI. We will be updating documentation on the site to reflect the new name wherever it won't be
				confusing, but be aware that this is a potential source of confusion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>On the HAPI FHIR website: </b> Regular visitors to our site will probably already have noticed
				that we recently moved the site to a new URL ( <a href="http://hapifhir.io">http://hapifhir.io</a> ).
				This was done mostly to help make HAPI's URL a bit easier to remember.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>On the future: </b> For the next release, we are planning on moving away from the
				<code>javax.json</code> (JSR 353) library in favour of using Google GSON. JSR 353 seemed like
				a good choice when we started HAPI, but it has basically been abandoned and no longer seems like
				a good choice (especially given the headaches it causes on Android). This hopefully means that
				the next release will be able to do away with the "special" Android shade-jar releases and all of
				the Gradle file gymnastics that are required in order to use them.
			</p>

				As always, we welcome new contributions and contributors! Please feel free to get
				in touch if you are interested in getting involved with HAPI but don't know
				where to start.

           <p>
               This release has taken a lot longer than originally planned. Mainly this

				<b>July 13, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.1 Released</b> - HAPI 1.1 has been released!
				As always, you can see the complete list of what has
				changed by consulting the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>, and the
				<a href="./download.html">download page</a> has information on where to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR 1.1 is the first release with support for the HL7.org "reference implementation"
				structures. This is an exciting development for us, as it means the beginning of
				our move to bring the two Java implementations of FHIR together into one library.
				As a part of this harmonization, we have made a few minor API changes. Specifically,
				a few methods that previously returned
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/api/IResource.html">IResource</a></code>
				or
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/primitive/IdDt.html">IdDt</a></code>
				will now return parent interfaces of these classes:
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IBaseResource.html">IBaseResource</a></code>
				and
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IIdType.html">IIdType</a></code>
				respectively.
				Existing code can simply cast to IResource and IdDt as these classes are still in use, but
				new code may wish to take advantage of the new "RI" structures. During the next development
				cycle we will be integrating features from the HL7.org Java FHIR packages into HAPI, such as the
				instance/profile validator and the narrative generator.

                         <b>May 8, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.0 Released</b> - HAPI 1.0 has been released! As always, 1.0 brings lots of fixes and features, and also brings the DSTU2 model classes up to the May 2015 DSTU2 ballot candidate structure definitions. Upgrading is recommended.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         At the same time, I am uploading the first builds of HAPI FHIR 1.1-SNAPSHOT. In the next release cycle we are introducing support for the FHIR reference implementation structures. This is an exciting development because it marks the beginning of an effort to merge the two libraries. This will mean that RI users can take advantage of HAPI's powerful client and server frameworks, and HAPI users can take advantage of the RI's powerful validation tooling.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         I will note that 1.1 will bring a few minor API changes, so upgrading your application to this level may require a few tweaks. Specifically, a new interface (IBaseResource) has been introduced which acts as a superinterface for both HAPI's structures and the RI ones.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         The existing IResource (HAPI's resource interface) extends this new interface, as does an interface called IRefImplInterface which marks RI structures. Some methods in the parser and in the client which previously returned IResource (HAPI's resource interface) now return IBaseResource, so a cast to IResource may be required in some cases. If you are feeling adventurous and want to give these structures a spin, go for it! Feel free to post questions here.

                         The biggest development on our plate for the next development cycle will be to finish
                         the integration of the HL7.org structure classes. Some people may have noticed a project
                         in our GitHub repo called "hapi-fhir-structures-hl7org" that isn't a part of the current build.
                         What we are trying to do is to unify the HL7.org Java Reference Implementation data model with
                         the HAPI one in a single set of classes. This will mean that HAPI users can take advantage
                         of tools from the RI (such as the excellent validator that comes with it) and users of the
                         RI can take advantage of HAPI's client and server toolkits. It is still not 100% clear what
                         this integration will look like when it is complete, but that should become clear in the
                         coming weeks.

                         As always, thanks to everyone who contributed code, pull requests, and filed bugs to make
                         this release better. HAPI FHIR is the collective work of a large number of people now
                         and we all benefit from the collective hard work being put in from around the world!

				<b>Dec 17, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.8 Released</b> - HAPI 0.8 has been released!
				As always, thanks to everyone who contributed on this; this release includes
				a lot of bug fixes and new features from around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				See the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/changes-report.html">changelog</a>
				for a complete list of what's new!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, this release marks the beginning of our push to separate the model
				classes (e.g. Patient, Encounter, etc.) from the core API, so that you can use any
				version of the structures you want in your application, or even combine versions if
				you need to. As is the case with HAPI's HL7 v2 library, you now need to include at least
				one new separate "structures" JAR with your application as of HAPI-FHIR 0.8. See the
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_upgrading.html">Upgrading</a>
				and
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/download.html">Download</a>
				pages for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the newly separated "structures" dependencies, we have also introduced
				a separate "dev" version of the structures, which contains the current development
				structure definitions, which are now close to being in their final DSTU2 state
				(DSTU2 should be released in mid 2015 by HL7 although the date is not yet finalized).
				DSTU2 contains a number of new and updated resource definitions, but it also makes
				several infrastructure changes including a new Bundle format and a new encoding style
				for extensions in JSON. These changes are not yet supported in HAPI-FHIR 0.8, but
				will be included in HAPI-FHIR 0.9. We expect to deploy a working snapshot build of
				HAPI-FHIR 0.9 within the next day or so, including all of these changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				One further note: We are currently working with Grahame Grieve on an initiative
				to harmonize HAPI's model objects with the FHIR Java Reference Implementation. This
				means that developers should in the future be able to use either the HAPI built-in
				resource definitions or the ones shipped by HL7. The advantage to this is that
				it will allow users of HAPI's API to take advantage of other tooling produced
				by HL7 (such as profile validators). Please get in touch (either by email or
				on the Google Group) if you would like to help test this.

				<b>Oct 23, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.7 Released</b> - HAPI 0.7 has been released!
				This release contains a number of contributions and bugfixes from all over
				the FHIR community. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, note that this release corrects an issue where contained resources
				sometimes got encoded as both contained and top-level resources, and top level
				resources sometimes got encoded as contained resources. It is possible that some
				existing applications depended on the buggy behaviour, so please do a bit of extra
				testing on your server applications if you use contained resources at all. See
				the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_resource_references.html">resource references</a>
				documentation for a bit more information on how these work, and please feel free to
				post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/hapi-fhir">google group</a>
				if things aren't working as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release also introduces a fascinating <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
				based development environment contributed by Preston Lee which should allow you
				to try out a fully functional, database backed HAPI server in a virtual server
				on your own development box.

				<b>Sep 8, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.6 Released</b> - A new build has been uploaded,
				containing a number of new features and bug fixes. See the changelog
				for a complete list of what has changed.

			<p>
				<b>July 30, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.5 Released</b> - HAPI 0.5 has now been released.
				This is surprisingly soon after the last release (and probably not a
				pace we will sustain) but we landed a number of big fixes and enhancements
				over the last two weeks and it just didn't make sense to hold them.
				See the <a href="./doc_upgrading.html">upgrading page</a> for information on
				API changes in this release.

				<b>July 14, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.4 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has been
				tagged an uploaded to the Maven global repos and the GitHub releases section. See the changelog
				for more information. This release contains a large number of minor bugfixes and quite a few new
				features. Upgrading should be relatively simple, although there is one breaking API change (IdDt
				now can contain the complete URL of a resource, not just the logical ID).

				<b>May 12, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.3 Released</b> - A new release of HAPI FHIR has been deployed
				to the Maven repos and the Sourceforge download system. This release corrects a large number of
				bugs and includes fixes which were implemented in the recent FHIR Connectathon.

		<section name="What is HAPI FHIR?">
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR is a simple-but-powerful library for adding FHIR messaging to your application. It
				is pure Java (1.6+ compatible), and licensed under the business-friendly Apache Software
				License, version 2.0.
			</p>

			<subsection name="Some Ways You Can Use HAPI FHIR">
				<p>
					HAPI is designed with one main intent: providing a flexible way of adding
					FHIR capability to applications. We at <a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a>
					developed HAPI-FHIR to allow us to
					build up our own unified FHIR RESTful server which exposes data backed by
					a number of systems and repositories, so it is designed to be flexible
					above all else.
				</p>
				<p>
					The library is designed to support several main usage patterns:

					<object data="svg/hapi_usage_patterns.svg" width="672" height="468" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Fluent Interface">

				<p>
					The HAPI API is designed to allow interaction with
					FHIR model objects using a convenient
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">Fluent Interface</a>.
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.addIdentifier().setUse(OFFICIAL).setSystem("urn:fake:mrns").setValue("7000135");
patient.addIdentifier().setUse(SECONDARY).setSystem("urn:fake:otherids").setValue("3287486");

patient.addName().addFamily("Smith").addGiven("John").addGiven("Q").addSuffix("Junior");

patient.setGender(AdministrativeGenderEnum.MALE);]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Encoding Support">

				<p>
					Both XML and JSON encoding are suported natively using a simple API
					to pick between them. XML support is built on top of the lightning-fast
					<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/stax/why.html">STaX/JSR 173</a>
					API, and JSON support is provided using <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Google Gson</a>.
				</p>

				<source><![CDATA[FhirContext ctx = FhirContext.forDstu2();
String xmlEncoded = ctx.newXmlParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
String jsonEncoded = ctx.newJsonParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Easy RESTful Client and Servers">

				<p>
					Creating clients is simple and uses an annotation based format
					that will be familiar to users of JAX-WS.
				</p>

				<source><![CDATA[public interface MyClientInterface extends IRestfulClient
{
  /** A FHIR search */
  @Search
  public List<Patient> findPatientsByIdentifier(@RequiredParam(name="identifier") IdentifierDt theIdentifier);

  /** A FHIR create */
  @Create
  public MethodOutcome createPatient(@ResourceParam Patient thePatient);
}]]></source>

				<p>
					Using this client is as simple as:
				</p>

				<source><![CDATA[MyClientInterface client = ctx.newRestfulClient(MyClientInterface.class, "http://foo/fhir");
IdentifierDt searchParam = new IdentifierDt("urn:someidentifiers", "7000135");
List<Patient> clients = client.findPatientsByIdentifier(searchParam);]]></source>
