				<b>July 13, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.1 Released</b> - HAPI 1.1 has been released! 
				As always, you can see the complete list of what has
				changed by consulting the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>, and the
				<a href="./download.html">download page</a> has information on where to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR 1.1 is the first release with support for the HL7.org "reference implementation"
				structures. This is an exciting development for us, as it means the beginning of
				our move to bring the two Java implementations of FHIR together into one library.
				As a part of this harmonization, we have made a few minor API changes. Specifically,
				a few methods that previously returned 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/api/IResource.html">IResource</a></code> 
				or 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/primitive/IdDt.html">IdDt</a></code>
				will now return parent interfaces of these classes: 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IBaseResource.html">IBaseResource</a></code> 
				and
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IIdType.html">IIdType</a></code>
				respectively.
				Existing code can simply cast to IResource and IdDt as these classes are still in use, but
				new code may wish to take advantage of the new "RI" structures. During the next development
				cycle we will be integrating features from the HL7.org Java FHIR packages into HAPI, such as the
				instance/profile validator and the narrative generator.
			</p>
			<p> 
				See the <a href="./doc_dstu2.html">HAPI DSTU2 documentation</a> page for
				more information.

			<p>
				<b>May 8, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.0 Released</b> - HAPI 1.0 has been released! As always, 1.0 brings lots of fixes and features, and also brings the DSTU2 model classes up to the May 2015 DSTU2 ballot candidate structure definitions. Upgrading is recommended.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, I am uploading the first builds of HAPI FHIR 1.1-SNAPSHOT. In the next release cycle we are introducing support for the FHIR reference implementation structures. This is an exciting development because it marks the beginning of an effort to merge the two libraries. This will mean that RI users can take advantage of HAPI's powerful client and server frameworks, and HAPI users can take advantage of the RI's powerful validation tooling.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will note that 1.1 will bring a few minor API changes, so upgrading your application to this level may require a few tweaks. Specifically, a new interface (IBaseResource) has been introduced which acts as a superinterface for both HAPI's structures and the RI ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				The existing IResource (HAPI's resource interface) extends this new interface, as does an interface called IRefImplInterface which marks RI structures. Some methods in the parser and in the client which previously returned IResource (HAPI's resource interface) now return IBaseResource, so a cast to IResource may be required in some cases. If you are feeling adventurous and want to give these structures a spin, go for it! Feel free to post questions here.

				<b>March 14, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 0.9 Released</b> - HAPI 0.9 has now been released. This 
				release is an important one. It brings a number of fixes and new features, and most importantly
				brings suport for DSTU2 resources and parsing/encoding. DSTU2 is the upcoming next version
				of the FHIR specification itself. Also of particular note, the 
				<a href="./doc_jpa.html">JPA Server</a> has graduated to being included in the
				Maven repos (so you can create your own server which works just like <a href="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca">ours</a>).
				The <a href="./doc_android.html">Android JAR</a> has also been included.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, you can see the complete list of what has
				changed by consulting the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>, and the
				<a href="./download.html">download page</a> has information on where to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Note on DSTU2:</b> It is important to note that DSTU2 is not yet formally ballotted by HL7, and as such it 
				is subject to change. A number of developers are starting to target it however, so support
				was important to us at HAPI HQ. See the <a href="./doc_dstu2.html">HAPI DSTU2 page</a>
				for information about how to add support for FHIR DSTU2 in your applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What's Next:</b> We are planning on making the next release of HAPI be the 1.0 release.
				The biggest development on our plate for the next development cycle will be to finish
				the integration of the HL7.org structure classes. Some people may have noticed a project
				in our GitHub repo called "hapi-fhir-structures-hl7org" that isn't a part of the current build.
				What we are trying to do is to unify the HL7.org Java Reference Implementation data model with
				the HAPI one in a single set of classes. This will mean that HAPI users can take advantage
				of tools from the RI (such as the excellent validator that comes with it) and users of the
				RI can take advantage of HAPI's client and server toolkits. It is still not 100% clear what
				this integration will look like when it is complete, but that should become clear in the 
				coming weeks.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, thanks to everyone who contributed code, pull requests, and filed bugs to make
				this release better. HAPI FHIR is the collective work of a large number of people now
				and we all benefit from the collective hard work being put in from around the world!

				<b>Dec 17, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.8 Released</b> - HAPI 0.8 has been released!
				As always, thanks to everyone who contributed on this; this release includes
				a lot of bug fixes and new features from around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				See the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/changes-report.html">changelog</a>
				for a complete list of what's new!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, this release marks the beginning of our push to separate the model
				classes (e.g. Patient, Encounter, etc.) from the core API, so that you can use any 
				version of the structures you want in your application, or even combine versions if 
				you need to. As is the case with HAPI's HL7 v2 library, you now need to include at least
				one new separate "structures" JAR with your application as of HAPI-FHIR 0.8. See the
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_upgrading.html">Upgrading</a>
				and
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/download.html">Download</a>
				pages for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the newly separated "structures" dependencies, we have also introduced
				a separate "dev" version of the structures, which contains the current development
				structure definitions, which are now close to being in their final DSTU2 state 
				(DSTU2 should be released in mid 2015 by HL7 although the date is not yet finalized).
				DSTU2 contains a number of new and updated resource definitions, but it also makes
				several infrastructure changes including a new Bundle format and a new encoding style
				for extensions in JSON. These changes are not yet supported in HAPI-FHIR 0.8, but
				will be included in HAPI-FHIR 0.9. We expect to deploy a working snapshot build of
				HAPI-FHIR 0.9 within the next day or so, including all of these changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				One further note: We are currently working with Grahame Grieve on an initiative
				to harmonize HAPI's model objects with the FHIR Java Reference Implementation. This
				means that developers should in the future be able to use either the HAPI built-in
				resource definitions or the ones shipped by HL7. The advantage to this is that
				it will allow users of HAPI's API to take advantage of other tooling produced
				by HL7 (such as profile validators). Please get in touch (either by email or
				on the Google Group) if you would like to help test this.

				<b>Oct 23, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.7 Released</b> - HAPI 0.7 has been released!
				This release contains a number of contributions and bugfixes from all over
				the FHIR community. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, note that this release corrects an issue where contained resources 
				sometimes got encoded as both contained and top-level resources, and top level 
				resources sometimes got encoded as contained resources. It is possible that some 
				existing applications depended on the buggy behaviour, so please do a bit of extra 
				testing on your server applications if you use contained resources at all. See 
				the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_resource_references.html">resource references</a>
				documentation for a bit more information on how these work, and please feel free to 
				post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/hapi-fhir">google group</a>
				if things aren't working as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release also introduces a fascinating <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
				based development environment contributed by Preston Lee which should allow you 
				to try out a fully functional, database backed HAPI server in a virtual server 
				on your own development box.

				<b>July 30, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.5 Released</b> - HAPI 0.5 has now been released.
				This is surprisingly soon after the last release (and probably not a 
				pace we will sustain) but we landed a number of big fixes and enhancements
				over the last two weeks and it just didn't make sense to hold them.

				<b>July 14, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.4 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has been
				tagged an uploaded to the Maven global repos and the GitHub releases section. See the changelog
				for more information. This release contains a large number of minor bugfixes and quite a few new
				features. Upgrading should be relatively simple, although there is one breaking API change (IdDt
				now can contain the complete URL of a resource, not just the logical ID).

				<b>May 12, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.3 Released</b> - A new release of HAPI FHIR has been deployed

		<section name="What is HAPI FHIR?">
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR is a simple-but-powerful library for adding FHIR messaging to your application. It
				is pure Java (1.6+ compatible), and licensed under the business-friendly Apache Software
				License, version 2.0.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Some Ways You Can Use HAPI FHIR">
				<p>
					HAPI is designed with one main intent: providing a flexible way of adding
					FHIR capability to applications. We at <a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a> 
					developed HAPI-FHIR to allow us to 
					build up our own unified FHIR RESTful server which exposes data backed by
					a number of systems and repositories, so it is designed to be flexible
					above all else. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The library is designed to support several main usage patterns:

			<subsection name="Fluent Interface">
			
				<p>
					The HAPI API is designed to allow interaction with 
					FHIR model objects using a convenient
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">Fluent Interface</a>.

patient.addIdentifier().setUse(OFFICIAL).setSystem("urn:fake:mrns").setValue("7000135");
patient.addIdentifier().setUse(SECONDARY).setSystem("urn:fake:otherids").setValue("3287486");

patient.addName().addFamily("Smith").addGiven("John").addGiven("Q").addSuffix("Junior");

patient.setGender(AdministrativeGenderEnum.MALE);]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Encoding Support">
						
				<p>
					Both XML and JSON encoding are suported natively using a simple API
					to pick between them. XML support is built on top of the lightning-fast 
					<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/stax/why.html">STaX/JSR 173</a> 
					API, and JSON support is provided using the new
					<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353">javax.json/JSR-353</a> API. 
				</p>
	
				<source><![CDATA[FhirContext ctx = FhirContext.forDstu2();
String xmlEncoded = ctx.newXmlParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
String jsonEncoded = ctx.newJsonParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Easy RESTful Client and Servers">

				<p>
					Creating clients is simple and uses an annotation based format
					that will be familiar to users of JAX-WS.
				</p>
				
				<source><![CDATA[public interface MyClientInterface extends IRestfulClient
{
  /** A FHIR search */

  public List<Patient> findPatientsByIdentifier(@RequiredParam(name="identifier") IdentifierDt theIdentifier);
	
  /** A FHIR create */
  @Create
  public MethodOutcome createPatient(@ResourceParam Patient thePatient);
}]]></source>

				<p>
					Using this client is as simple as:
				</p>
				
				<source><![CDATA[MyClientInterface client = ctx.newRestfulClient(MyClientInterface.class, "http://foo/fhir");
IdentifierDt searchParam = new IdentifierDt("urn:someidentifiers", "7000135");
List<Patient> clients = client.findPatientsByIdentifier(searchParam);]]></source>
