		<section name="Command Line Tool for HAPI FHIR">
			<p>
				<b>hapi-fhir-cli</b> is the HAPI FHIR Command Line tool. It features a number of HAPI's
				built-in features as easy to use command line options. 
			</p>

			<subsection name="Download and Installation">
				<p>
					You can get the tool by downloading it from our
					<a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/releases">GitHub Releases</a> page
					(look for the archive named <code>hapi-fhir-[version]-cli.tar.bz2</code> on OSX/Linux or <code>hapi-fhir-[version]-cli.zip</code> on Windows).
				</p>
				<p>
					When you have downloaded the archive (either ZIP or tar.bz2), expand it into a directory
					where you will keep it, and add this directory to your path. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You can now try the tool out by executing the following command: <code>hapi-fhir-cli</code>
				</p>
				<p>
					This command should show a help screen, as shown in the screeenshot below.
				</p>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Download and Installation - Mac/OSX">

				<p>
					hapi-fhir-cli is available as a <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> package
					for Mac. It can be installed using the following command:
				</p>
				<code>brew install hapi-fhir-cli</code>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Troubleshooting">
				<p>
					<b>Note on Java version support:</b> The HAPI library is designed to
					work in Java 6+, but the Command Line Tool required a minimum of Java 8. This
					is because the Jetty Web Server that is used within the tool has this requirement. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The tool should work correctly on any system that has Java 8 (or newer) installed. If
					it is not working correctly, first try the following command to test if Java is installed:<br/>
					<code>$ java -version</code>
				</p>
				<p>
					If this command does not produce output similar to the following, you should install/reinstall
					Java.<br/>
					<pre><![CDATA[$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)]]></pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					If this does not help, please post a question on our
					<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/hapi-fhir">Google Group</a>.

		<section name="Server (run-server)">
			<p>
				The CLI tool can be used to start a local, fully functional FHIR server which you can use
				for testing. To start this server, simply issue the command <code>hapi-fhir-cli run-server</code>
				as shown in the example below:
			</p>
			<img src="./images/hapi-fhir-cli-run-server.png" alt="Run Server" style="margin-left: 40px;"/>
			<p>
				Once the server has started, you can access the testing webpage by pointing your
				browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>. The FHIR
				server base URL will be <a href="http://localhost:8080/baseDstu2/">http://localhost:8080/baseDstu2/</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that by default this server will not be populated with any resources at all. You can
				easily populate it with the FHIR example resources by <b>leaving it running</b> and opening
				a second terminal window, then using the <code>hapi-fhir-cli upload-examples</code> command
				(see the section below).
			</p>
			<p>
				The server uses a local Derby database instance for storage. You may want to execute 
				this command in an empty directory, which you can clear if you want to reset the server.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section name="Upload Example Resources (upload-examples)">
			<p>
				The <b>upload-examples</b> command downloads the complete set of FHIR example resources from
				the HL7 website, and uploads them to a server of your choice. This can be useful to
				populate a server with test data.
			</p>
			<p>
				To execute this command, uploading test resources to a local CLI server, issue
				the following: <code>hapi-fhir-cli upload-examples -t http://localhost:8080/baseDstu2</code> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this command may take a surprisingly long time to complete because of the 
				large number of examples.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section name="Upload Terminology">
		
			<p>
				The HAPI FHIR JPA server has a terminology server, and has the ability to 
				be populated with "external" code systems. These code systems are systems
				that contain large numbers of codes, so the codes are not stored directly
				inside the resource body.
			</p>
			<p>
				HAPI has methods for uploading several popular code systems into its tables
				using the distribution files produced by the respective code systems. This
				is done using the <code>upload-terminology</code> command. The following
				examples show how to do this for several popular code systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the path and exact filename of the terminology files will likely
				need to be adjusted for your local disk structure.

		<section name="Migrate Database">

			<p>
				The <code>migrate-database</code> command may be used to Migrate a database
				schema when upgrading a
				<a href="./doc_jpa.html">HAPI FHIR JPA</a> project from one version of HAPI
				FHIR to another version.
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="./doc_jpa.html#upgrading">Upgrading HAPI FHIR JPA</a>
				for information on how to use this command.
