		<section name="Working with Resources">
			
			<p>
				Every resource type defined by FHIR has a corresponding 
				class, which contains a number of getters and setters for 
				the basic properties of that resource.
			</p>

			<p>
				HAPI tries to make populating objects easier, by providing lots of 
				convenience methods. For example, the Observation resource has an
				"issued" property which is of the FHIR "instant" type (a system time with
				either seconds or milliseconds precision). There are methods to
				use the actual FHIR datatype, but also convenience methods which
				use built-in Java types.

			<subsection name="Navigating Structures">
			
				<p>
					Most HAPI structures provide getters that automatically create
					child objects on access. This means it is simple to navigate 
					complex structures without needing to worry about instantiating
					child objects.
				</p>

					<param name="id" value="nonNull" />

				</macro>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Coded/Enumerated Values">
			
				<p>
					There are many places in the FHIR specification where a "coded" string is
					used. This means that a code must be chosen from a list of allowable values.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Closed Valuesets / Codes</h4>
				
				<p>
					The FHIR specification defines a number of "closed" ValueSets, such as
					the one used for
					<!-- TODO: replace the link below with a non GitHub link once DSTU2 is balloted -->
					<a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/administrative-gender.html">Patient.gender</a>
					(<i>note that this field was not a closed ValueSet in DSTU1 but is as of DSTU2</i>).
					These valuesets must either be empty, or be populated with a value drawn from
					the list of allowable values defined by FHIR. HAPI provides special typesafe
					Enums to help in dealing with these fields.
				</p>
				
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="codes" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/FhirDataModel.java" />
				</macro>

				<h4>Open Valusets / CodeableConcepts</h4>
				
				<p>
					The FHIR specification also defines a number of "open" ValueSets, such as
					the one used for
					<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/valueset-marital-status.html">Patient.maritalStatus</a>.
					These fields may define a set of allowable codes, but also allow you to 
					use your own codes instead if none of the given codes matches your needs. This
					is called an <a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/terminologies.html#incomplete">incomplete binding</a>.
					Some fields may even define a set of codes that serve as nothing more than
					an example as to the type of codes that would be used there. This is known as
					an <a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/terminologies.html#example">example binding</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For these fields, a CodeableConcept datatype is generally used by the 
					FHIR specification. This datatype allows multiple "codings", which
					are a code and codesystem pair, optionally with a display name as well.
					The following example shows how to interact with this type.
				</p>

				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="codeableConcepts" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/FhirDataModel.java" />
				</macro>

				<p>
					HAPI also provides typesafe enums to help in working with CodeableConcept
					fields.
				</p>
				
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="codeableConceptEnums" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/FhirDataModel.java" />
				</macro>
				
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="Convenience Methods">
				
				<p>
					The FHIR data model is rich enough to meet common use cases, but sometimes
					that richness adds complexity. For example, a Patient may have multiple names
					(a preferred name, a nickname, etc.) and each of those names may have multiple
					last names, multiple prefixes, etc.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					The example below shows populating a name entry for a Patient. Note the
					use of the StringDt type, which encapsulates a regular String, but allows for
					extensions to be added.
				</p>
			
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="namesHard" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/FhirDataModel.java" />
				</macro>
			
				<p>
					HAPI also provides for simple setters that use Java primitive types
					and can be chained, leading to much simpler code.
				</p>

					<param name="id" value="namesEasy" />
					<param name="file" value="examples/src/main/java/example/FhirDataModel.java" />
