				JSON parsing in HAPI FHIR has been switched from using JSR353 (javax.json) to
				using Google Gson. For this reason we are bumping the major release number to
				2.0. Theoretically this should not affect projects in any major way, but Gson
				does have subtle differences. Two differences which popped up a fair bit in
				our own testing:
				<![CDATA[
				<ul>
					<ul>
						A space is placed after the : in keys, e.g. what was previously
						encoded as <code>"resourceType":"Patient"</code> is now encoded
						as <code>"resourceType": "Patient"</code> (this broke a number of
						our unit tests with hardcoded resource definitions)
					</ul>
					<ul>
						Trailing content after a valid json resource is rejected by
						Gson (it was ignored by the Glassfish parser we were previously
						using even though it was invalid)
					</ul>

				This means that the server now supports 
				<![CDATA[<code>application/fhir+xml</code> and <code>application/fhir+json</code>]]>
				in addition to the older style
				<![CDATA[<code>application/xml+fhir</code> and <code>application/json+fhir</code>]]>.
				In order to facilitate migration by implementors, the old style remains the default
				for now, but the server will respond using the new style if the request contains it. The
				client now uses an <![CDATA[<code>Accept</code>]]> header value which requests both 
				styles with a preference given to the new style when running in DSTU3 mode.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				As a part of this change, the server has also been enhanced so that if a request
				contains a Content-Type header but no Accept header, the response will prefer the
				encoding specified by the Content-Type header.

				HAPI has a number of RESTful method parameter types that have similar but not identical

				This means that a number of existing classes
				have been deprocated in favour of new naming schemes.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All annotation-based clients and all server search method parameters are now named
				(type)Param, for example: StringParam, TokenParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All generic/fluent client method parameters are now named
				(type)ClientParam, for example: StringClientParam, TokenClientParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All renamed classes have been retained and deprocated, so this change should not cause any issues
				for existing applications but those applications should be refactored to use the 
				new parameters when possible.
