			<action type="fix" issue="1583">
				As of FHIR R4, some fields that were previously of type reference are now of type canonical.
				One example is QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire. Technically this means that this field
				should no longer contain a relative reference, but as they are sometimes used that way, HAPI
				FHIR will now try to be permissive and will index relative link canonical fields
				such as (Questionnaire/123) as though it actually was a local relative link. Thanks to
				Dean Atchley for reporting and providing a test case!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				ValueSet PreCalculation did not successfully expand valuesets when Lucene was not enabled
				in the JPA server. This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				When parsing Bundle resources containing other resources, XML/JSON parsers have an option called
				"override resource ID with bundle entry fullUrl". This option previously caused any value
				found in Bundle.entry.fullUrl to override any value found in
				Bundle.entry.resource.id (meaning that the parsed resource would take its ID from
				the fullUrl even if that ID disagreed with the ID found in the resource itself. As of
				HAPI FHIR 4.1.0 the value in Bundle.entry.fullUrl will only be used to set the parsed resource
				ID if the resource has no ID present.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Chained searches using the _has search parameter as the chain value are now supported by
				the JPA server.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				Changed database migration to use flyway. This adds a new table called FLY_HFJ_MIGRATION that records all
				database migration tasks that have already been applied.  The hapi-fhir-cli migrate tool has been changed
				to use flyway.  Learn more about flyway here: https://flywaydb.org/.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1613">
				ValueSet Precalculation sometimes failed on Oracle DBs due to an invalid SQL function. This
				has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				A ConcurrentModificationException was sometimes thrown when performing a cascading delete.
				This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1624">
				The constructor for Verdict.java was inadvertantly made private, preventing custom
				rules from being written. Thanks to Jafer Khan for the pull request!
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				The
				<![CDATA[
				<code>IRestfulClient#registerInterceptor</code>
				and
				<code>IRestfulClient#unregisterInterceptor</code>
				]]>
				methods now take Object as an argument instead of IClientInterceptor, allowing
				client interceptors to now be migrated to the new interceptor
				framework.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1610">
				A missing mandatory was added to the SNOMED CT CodeSystem that is uploaded when SCT is
				uploaded to the JPA server. Thanks to Anders Havn for the pull request!

			<action type="fix">
				An issue with the HAPI FHIR CLI was corrected that prevented the upload of LOINC due to an error
				regarding the properties file.

				<b>New Feature</b>:
				The JPA server now saves and supports searching on <code>Resource.meta.source</code> via the
				<code>_source</code> search parameter. The server automatically
				appends the Request ID as a hash value on the URI as well in order to provide request level tracking. Searches
				 can use either the source URI, the request ID, or both.

			<action type="add">
            <![CDATA[
				<b>New Feature</b>:
				Support for the FHIR Bulk Data Export specification has been added to the JPA server. See the
				<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/">specification</a> for information on how this works. Note that
				only system level export is currently supported but others will follow.

            <![CDATA[
				<b>New Feature</b>:
				Support for ElasticSearch has been added to the JPA server directly (i.e. without needing a separate
				module) and a new class called "ElasticsearchHibernatePropertiesBuilder" has been added to facilitate
				the creation of relevant properties. Instructions have been added to the hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter
				project to get started with Elasticsearch. It is likely we will switch our default recommendation
				to Elastic in the future.

			<action type="fix">
				<![CDATA[
				<b>New Feature</b>:
				A new set of operations have been added to the JPA server that allow CodeSystem deltas to be
				uploaded. A CodeSystem Delta consists of a set of codes and relationships that are added or
				removed incrementally to the live CodeSystem without requiring a downtime or a complete
				upload of the contents. Deltas may be specified using either a custom CSV format or a partial 
				CodeSystem resource.
				<br/>
				In addition, the HAPI FHIR CLI
				<code>upload-terminology</code> command has been modified to support this new functionality.

				<b>Performance Improvement</b>:
				A significant performance improvement was made to the parsers (particularly the Json Parser)
				when serializing resources. This work yields improvements of 20-50% in raw encode speed when
				encoding large resources. Thanks to David Maplesden for the pull request!

				<b>Performance Improvement</b>:
				When running inside a JPA server, The DSTU3+ validator now performs code validations
				by directly testing ValueSet membership against a pre-calculated copy of the ValueSet,
				instead of first expanding the ValueSet and then examining the expanded contents.
				This can yield a significant improvement in validation speed in many cases.
            ]]>

			<action type="add" issue="1357">
				The email Subscription deliverer now respects the payload property of the subscription
				when deciding how to encode the resource being sent. Thanks to Sean McIlvenna for the 
				pull request!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				When using the _filter search parameter, string comparisons using the "eq" operator
				were incorrectly performing a partial match. This has been corrected. Thanks to 
				Marc Sandberg for pointing this out!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				When using the AuthorizationInterceptor with a rule to allow all reads by resource type,
				the server will now reject requests for other resource types earlier in the processing
				cycle. Thanks to Anders Havn for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Reference search parameters did not work via the _filter parameter
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Transaction entries with a resource URL starting with a leading
				slash (e.g. 
				<![CDATA[<code>/Organization?identifier=foo</code>]]>
				instead of
				<![CDATA[<code>Organization?identifier=foo</code>]]>
				did not work. These are now supported.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				SubscriptionDstu2Config incorrectly pointed to a DSTU3 configuration file. This
				has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				When using the VersionedApiConverterInterceptor, GraphQL responses failed with an HTTP
				500 error.

			<action type="fix">
				Cascading deletes now correctly handle circular references. Previously this failed with
				an HTTP 500 error.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				The informational message returned in an OperationOutcome when a delete failed due to cascades not being enabled
				contained an incorrect example. This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				 In some cases, deleting a CodeSystem resource would fail because the underlying
				 codes were not correctly deleted from the terminology service tables. This is
				 fixed.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				Two foreign keys have been dropped from the HFJ_SEARCH_RESULT table used by the FHIR search query cache. These
				constraints did not add value and caused unneccessary contention when used under high load.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				An inefficient regex expression in UrlUtil was replaced with a much more efficient hand-written
				checker. This regex was causing a noticable performance drop when feeding large numbers of transactions
				into the JPA server at the same time (i.e. when loading Synthea data).
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				The FHIRPath engine used to parse search parameters in the JPA R4/R5 server is now reused across
				requests, as it is somewhat expensive to create and is thread safe.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				It is now possible to submit a PATCH request as a part of a FHIR transaction in DSTU3 (previously this
				was only supported in R4+). This is not officially part of the DSTU3 spec, but it can now be performed by
				leaving the Bundle.entry.request.method blank in DSTU3 transactions and setting the request payload
				as a Binary resource containing a valid patch.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				The HAPI FHIR CLI server now uses H2 as its database platform instead of Derby.
				Note that this means that data in any existing installations will need to be
				re-uploaded to the new database platform.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1443">
				LOINC concepts now include multiaxial hierarchical properties (e.g. <![CDATA[<code>parent</code>]]> and
				<![CDATA[<code>child</code>]]>, which identify parent and child concepts.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1445">
				When loading LOINC terminology, a new ValueSet is automatically created with a single include element that
				identifies the LOINC CodeSystem in <![CDATA[<code>ValueSet.compose.include.system</code>]]>. This ValueSet
				includes all LOINC codes.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1461">
				A note has been added to the downloads page explaning the removal of the hapi-fhir-utilities
				module. Thanks to Andrew Fitzgerald for the PR!
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				REST servers will no longer try to guess the content type for HTTP requests where a body 
				is provided but no Content-Type header is included. These requests are invalid, and will now
				result in an HTTP 400. This change corrects an error where some interceptors (notably
				the RequestValidatingInterceptor, but not including any HAPI FHIR security interceptors) 
				could be bypassed if a Content Type was not included.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				The GraphQL provider did not wrap the respone in a "data" element as described in the FHIR
				specification. This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Added support for comparing resource dates to the current time via a new variable %now.  E.g.
				Procedure?date=gt%now would match future procedures.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add support for in-memory matching on date comparisons ge,gt,eq,lt,le.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				When using the Consent Service and denying a resource via the "Will See Resource" method, the resource ID
				and version were still returned to the user. This has been corrected so that no details about
				the resource are leaked.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Fix a failure in FhirTerser#visit when fields in model classes being visited contain custom subclasses of the
				expected type.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Updating an existing CodeSystem resource with a content mode of COMPLETE did not cause the
				terminology service to accurately reflect the new CodeSystem URL and/or concepts. This is now
				corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				The JPA server now uses the Quartz scheduling library as a lob scheduling mechanism
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				The Testpage Overlay has been upgraded to use FontAwesome 5.x, and now supports being
				deployed to a servlet path other than "/".
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1495">
				A NullPointerException when using the AuthorizationInterceptor RuleBuilder to build a conditional
				rule with a custom tester has been corrected. Thanks to Tue Toft Nørgård for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1494">
				The R4+ client and server modules did not recognize the new
				<![CDATA[<code>_include:iterate</code>]]>
				syntax that replaces the previous
				<![CDATA[<code>_include:recurse</code>]]>
				syntax. Both are now supported on all servers in order to avoid breaking backwards
				compatibility, with the new syntax now being emitted in R4+ clients.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				The hapi-fhir-jaxrs-server module now lists dependencies on structures JARs as optional
				dependencies, in order to avoid automatically importing all versions. This means that implementers
				of JAX-RS servers may now need to add an explicit dependency on one or more structures JARs to
				their own project.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1482">
				The LOINC terminology distribution includes multiple copies of the same files. Uploading LOINC terminology
				resulted in some ValueSets with duplicate codes. This has been corrected by specifying a path with each
				filename.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				A corner case bug in the JPA server was solved: When performing a search that contained chained reference searches
				where the value contained slashes (e.g.
				<![CDATA[<code>Observation?derived-from:DocumentReference.contenttype=application/vnd.mfer</code>]]>)
				the server could fail to load later pages in the search results.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				A new flag has been added to the JPA migrator tool that causes the migrator to not try to reduce the length
				of existing columns in the schema.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1483">
				Some resource IDs and URLs for LOINC ValueSets and ConceptMaps were inconsistently populated by the
				terminology uploader. This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				When a resource was updated with a meta.source containing a request id, the meta.source was getting appended
				with the new request id, resulting in an ever growing source.meta value.  E.g. after the first update, it looks
				like "#9f0a901387128111#5f37835ee38a89e2" when it should only be "#5f37835ee38a89e2". This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1421">
				The Plain Server method selector was incorrectly allowing client requests with _include statements to be
				handled by method implementations that did not have any <![CDATA[<code>@IncludeParam</code>]]> defined. This
				is now corrected. Thanks to Tuomo Ala-Vannesluoma for reporting and providing a test case!
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1366">
				The ValueSet operation <![CDATA[<code>$expand</code>]]> has been optimized for large ValueSets. ValueSets are
				now persistence-backed by the terminology tables, which are populated by a scheduled pre-expansion process.
				A ValueSet previously stored in an existing FHIR repository will need to be re-created or updated to make
				it a candidate for pre-expansion. ValueSets that have yet to be pre-expanded will continue to be expanded
				in-memory.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1431">
				The ValueSet operation <![CDATA[<code>$validate-code</code>]]> has been optimized for large ValueSets.
				Codes in ValueSets that have yet to be pre-expanded will continue to be validated in-memory.

			<action type="add" issue="1447">
				LOINC filenames for terminology upload are now configurable using the
				<![CDATA[<code>loincupload.properties</code>]]> file.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1451">
				Support for the LOINC <![CDATA[<code>EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE</code>]]> property and
				<![CDATA[<code>copyright</code>]]> filter has been added.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1453">
				Support for the LOINC <![CDATA[<code>parent</code>]]> and <![CDATA[<code>child</code>]]> filters has been
				added. Both filters can be used with either of the <![CDATA[<code>=</code>]]> or
				<![CDATA[<code>in</code>]]> operators.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1454">
				Support for the LOINC <![CDATA[<code>ancestor</code>]]> and <![CDATA[<code>descendant</code>]]> filters has
				been added. The <![CDATA[<code>descendant</code>]]> filter can be used with either of the
				<![CDATA[<code>=</code>]]> or <![CDATA[<code>in</code>]]> operators. At present, the
				<![CDATA[<code>ancestor</code>]]> filter can only be used with the <![CDATA[<code>=</code>]]> operator.

			<action type="add" issue="1512">
				Support for the LOINC <![CDATA[<code>ancestor</code>]]> filter with the <![CDATA[<code>in</code>]]>
				operator has been added.

			<action type="fix">
				The JPA server failed to find codes defined in not-present codesystems in some cases, and reported
				that the CodeSystem did not exist. This has been corrected.
			</action>
			<action type="remove">
				The method
				<![CDATA[
				<code>IVersionSpecificBundleFactory#initializeBundleFromResourceList</code>
				]]>
				has been deprecated, as it provided duplicate functionality to other methods and had an 
				outdated argument list based on the Bundle needs in DSTU1. We are not aware of any
				public use of this API, please let us know if this deprecation causes any issues.
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1517">
				Support for concept property values with a length exceeding 500 characters has been added in the terminology
				tables. In particular, this was added to facilitate the LOINC EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE property, for which
				values can be quite long.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				The AuthorizationInterceptor has been enhanced so that a user can be authorized to
				perform create operations specifically, without authorizing all write operations. Also, 
				conditional creates can now be authorized even if they are happening inside a FHIR
				transaction.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="402">
				When encoding a Composition resource in XML, the section narrative blocks were incorrectly
				replaced by the main resource narrative. Thanks to Mirjam Baltus for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="1473">
				AN issue with date pickers not working in the hapi-fhir-testpage-overlay
				project has been fixed. Thanks to GitHub user @jaferkhan for the pull

			<action type="fix">
				The JPA server contained a restriction on the columns used to hold a resource's type name

			<action type="fix">
				The subscription triggering operation was not able to handle commas within search URLs being
				used to trigger resources for subscription checking. This has been corrected.

				In the (fairly unlikely) circumstance that a JPA server was called with a parameter where the parameter name referenced
				a custom search parameter with an invalid chain attached, and the value was missing entirely (e.g.
				<![CDATA[<code>ProcedureRequest?someCustomParameter.BAD_NAME=</code>]]>, the server would ignore this
				parameter instead of incorrectly returning an error. This has been corrected.

				The JPA server in DST2 mode previously automatically validated submitted QuestionnaireResponse resource against
				their corresponding Questionnaires and rejected non-conformant QuestionnaireResponse resources from being

				<b>Breaking Change</b>:
				The HL7.org DSTU2 structures (and <i>ONLY</i> the HL7.org DSTU2 structures) have been
				moved to a new package. Where they were previously found in 
				<code>org.hl7.fhir.instance.model</code>
				they are now found in
				<code>org.hl7.fhir.dstu2.model</code>. This was done in order to complete the harmonization
				between the

				GitHub repository and the 
				<a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/">org.hl7.fhir.core</a>
				GitHub repository. This is the kind of change we don't make lightly, as we do know that it
				will be annoying for users of the existing library. It is a change however that will allow us
				to apply validator fixes much more quickly, and will greatly reduce the amount of effort
				required to keep up with R5 changes as they come out, so we're hoping it is worth it.
				Note that no classes are removed, they have only been moved, so it should be fairly straightforward
				to migrate existing code with an IDE.

				Changed subscription processing, if the subscription criteria are straightforward (i.e. no
				chained references, qualifiers or prefixes) then attempt to match the incoming resource against
				the criteria in-memory. If the subscription criteria can't be matched in-memory, then the
				server falls back to the original subscription matching process of querying the database. The
				in-memory matcher can be disabled by setting isEnableInMemorySubscriptionMatching to "false" in
				DaoConfig (by default it is true). If isEnableInMemorySubscriptionMatching is "false", then all
				subscription matching will query the database as before.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				Removed BaseSubscriptionInterceptor and all its subclasses (RestHook, EMail, WebSocket). These are replaced
				by two new interceptors: SubscriptionActivatingInterceptor that is responsible for activating subscriptions
				and SubscriptionMatchingInterceptor that is responsible for matching incoming resources against activated
				subscriptions. Call DaoConfig.addSupportedSubscriptionType(type) to configure which subscription types
				are supported in your environment. If you are processing subscriptions on a separate server and only want
				to activate subscriptions on this server, you should set DaoConfig.setSubscriptionMatchingEnabled to false.
				The helper method SubscriptionInterceptorLoader.registerInterceptors()
				will check if any subscription types are supported, and if so then load active subscriptions into the
				SubscriptionRegistry and register the subscription activating interceptor. This method also registers
				the subscription matching interceptor (that matches incoming resources and sends matches to subscription
				channels) only if DaoConfig.isSubscriptionMatchingEnabled is true.
				See https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/wiki/Proposed-Subscription-Design-Change for more
				details.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				Added support for matching subscriptions in a separate server from the REST Server. To do this, run the
				SubscriptionActivatingInterceptor on the REST server and the SubscriptionMatchingInterceptor in the
				standalone server. Classes required to support running a standalone subscription server are in the
				ca.uhn.fhir.jpa.subscription.module.standalone package. These classes are excluded by default from
				the JPA ApplicationContext (that package is explicitly filtered out in the BaseConfig.java @ComponentScan).

			<action type="add">
				Changed behaviour of FHIR Server to reject subscriptions with invalid criteria. If a Subscription
				is submitted with invalid criteria, the server returns HTTP 422 "Unprocessable Entity" and the
				Subscription is not persisted.

			<action type="fix">
				The JPA server $expunge operation could sometimes fail to expunge if
				another resource linked to a resource that was being
				expunged. This has been corrected. In addition, the $expunge operation
				has been refactored to use smaller chunks of work
				within a single DB transaction. This improves performance and reduces contention when

				The ResponseHighlighterInterceptor now declines to handle Binary responses
				provided as a response from extended operations. In other words if the

				JPA Migrator tool enhancements:
				An invalid SQL syntax issue has been fixed when running the CLI JPA Migrator tool against

				In the JPA server, when performing a chained reference search on a search parameter with
				a target type of
				<![CDATA[<code>Reference(Any)</code>]]>, the search failed with an incomprehensible

				When updating existing resources, the JPA server will now attempt to reuse/update

			<action type="add">
				Added 3 interfaces for services required by the standalone subscription server. The standalone subscription
				server doesn't have access to a database and so needs to get its resources using a FhirClient. Thus
				for each of these interfaces, there are two implementations: a Dao implementaiton and a FhirClient
				implementation. The interfaces thus introduced are ISubscriptionProvider (used to load subscriptions
				into the SubscriptionRegistry), the IResourceProvider (used to get the latest version of a resource
				if the "get latest version" flag is set on the subscription) and ISearchParamProvider used to load
				custom search parameters.
			</action>
			<action type="change">
				Separated active subscription cache from the interceptors into a new Spring component called the
				SubscriptionRegistry. This component maintains a cache of ActiveSubscriptions. An ActiveSubscription
				contains the subscription, it's delivery channel, and a list of delivery handlers.

			<action type="change">
				Introduced a new Spring factory interface ISubscribableChannelFactory that is used to create delivery

				In a DSTU2 server, if search parameters are expressed with chains directly in the

				to re-run the search for every page of results that is loaded.
				In previous versions of HAPI FHIR, when a search was made the SearchCoordinator would
				prefetch as many results as the user could possibly request across all pages (even if
				this meant prefetching thousands or millions of resources).
				As of this version, a new option has been added to DaoConfig that specifies how many
				resources to prefetch. This can have a significant impact on performance for servers
				with a large number of resources, where users often only want the first page
				of results.
				See
				<![CDATA[<code>DatConfig#setSearchPreFetchThresholds()</code>]]>

				places, the database consumed more space than is needed to.

				In order to reduce this duplication, the
				<![CDATA[<code>RES_TEXT</code> and <code>RES_ENCODING</code>]]>
				columns have been
				<![CDATA[<b>dropped</b>]]>

				The validation module has been refactored to use the R4 (currently maintained)

				Support for FHIR R4 (current working draft) has been <![CDATA[<b>added</b>]]>

				and
				support for FHIR DSTU1 (<![CDATA[<code>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu</code>]]>)

				confusing legacy parts of the API (such as the legacy Atom Bundle class).

				HAPI FHIR's modules have been restructured for more consistency and less coupling

				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				A new complete list of HAPI FHIR modules has been added to the
				<![CDATA[<a href="http://hapifhir.io/download.html">Download Page</a>]]>. Key changes
				include:
				<![CDATA[
				<ul>
					<li>
						HAPI FHIR's <b>client</b> codebase has been moved out of <code>hapi-fhir-base</code>
						and in to a new module called <code>hapi-fhir-client</code>. Client users now need
						to explicitly add this JAR to their project (and non-client users now no longer
						need to depend on it)
					</li>
					<li>
						HAPI FHIR's <b>server</b> codebase has been moved out of <code>hapi-fhir-base</code>
						and in to a new module called <code>hapi-fhir-server</code>. Server users now need
						to explicitly add this JAR to their project (and non-server users now no longer
						need to depend on it)
					</li>
					<li>
						As a result of the client and server changes above, we no longer need to produce
						a special Android JAR which contains the client, server (which added space but was
						not used) and structures. There is now a normal module called <code>hapi-fhir-android</code>
						which is added to your Android Gradle file along with whatever structures JARs you
						wish to add. See the
						<a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-android-integration-test">Android Integration Test</a>
						to see a sample project using HAPI FHIR 3.0.0. <b>Note that this has been reported to
						work by some people but others are having issues with it!</b> In order to avoid delaying
						this release any further we are releasing now despite these issues. If you are an Android
						guru and want to help iron things out please get in touch. If not, it might be a good
						idea to stay on HAPI FHIR 2.5 until the next point release of the 3.x series.
					</li>
					<li>
						A new JAR containing FHIR utilities called <code>hapi-fhir-utilities</code> has been
						added. This JAR reflects the ongoing harmonization between HAPI FHIR and the FHIR
						RI codebases and is generally required in order to use HAPI at this point (if you
						are using a dependency manager such as Maven or Gradle it will be brought in to your
						project automatically as a dependency)

				In order to allow the reoganizations and decoupling above to happen, a number of important classes
				and interfaces have been moved to new packages. A sample list of these changes is listed
				below. When upgrading to 3.0.0 your project may well show a number of compile errors
				related to missing classes. In most cases this can be resolved by simply removing the HAPI
				imports from your classes and asking your IDE to "Organize Imports" once again. This is an
				annoying change we do realize, but it is neccesary in order to allow the project to
				continue to grow.

				JPA Subscription support has been refactored. A design contributed

				polling design.

				<![CDATA[
				This release includes significant performance enhancements for the
				JPA server. Most importantly, the way that searches are performed
				has been re-written to allow the server to perform better when
				the database has a large number of results in it. The following
				enhancements have been made:
				<br/><br/>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Searches with multiple search parameters of different 
						datatypes (e.g. find patients by name and date of birth) 
						were previously joined in Java code, now the join is 
						performed by the database which is faster
					</li>
					<li>
						Searches which returned lots of results previously has all 
						results streamed into memory before anything was returned to 
						the client. This is particularly slow if you do a search for
						(say) "get me all patients" since potentially thousands or 
						even millions of patients' IDs were loaded into memory 
						before anything gets returned to the client. HAPI FHIR 
						now has a multithreaded search coordinator which returns 
						results to the client as soon as they are available
					</li>
					<li>
						Search results will be cached and reused (so that if a client
						does two searches for "get me all patients matching FOO"
						with the same FOO in short succession, we won't query the DB
						again but will instead reuse the cached results). Note that
						this can improve performance, but does mean that searches can
						return slightly out of date results. Essentially what this means
						is that the latest version of individual resources will always
						be returned despite this cacheing, but newly created resources
						that should match may not be returned until the cache
						expires. By default this cache has been set to one minute, 
						which should be acceptable for most real-world usage, but
						this can be changed or disabled entirely.
					</li>
					<li>
						Updates which do not actually change the contents of the resource
						can optionally be prevented from creating a new version
						of the resource in the database
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br/><br/>
				Existing users should delete the 
				<code>HFJ_SEARCH</code>, 
				<code>HFJ_SEARCH_INCLUDE</code>,
				and 
				<code>HFJ_SEARCH_RESULT</code>
				tables from your database before upgrading, as the structure of these tables
				has changed and old search results can not be reused.

		<release version="0.5" date="2014-07-30">
			<action type="add">
				HAPI has a number of RESTful method parameter types that have similar but not identical
				purposes and confusing names. A cleanup has been undertaken to clean this up.
				This means that a number of existing classes
				have been deprocated in favour of new naming schemes.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All annotation-based clients and all server search method parameters are now named
				(type)Param, for example: StringParam, TokenParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All generic/fluent client method parameters are now named
				(type)ClientParam, for example: StringClientParam, TokenClientParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All renamed classes have been retained and deprocated, so this change should not cause any issues
				for existing applications but those applications should be refactored to use the
				new parameters when possible.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Allow server methods to return wildcard generic types (e.g. List&lt;? extends IResource&gt;)
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Search parameters are not properly escaped and unescaped. E.g. for a token parameter such as
				"&amp;identifier=system|codepart1\|codepart2"
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add support for OPTIONS verb (which returns the server conformance statement)
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add support for CORS headers in server
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Bump SLF4j dependency to latest version (1.7.7)
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add interceptor framework for clients (annotation based and generic), and add interceptors
				for configurable logging, capturing requests and responses, and HTTP basic auth.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Transaction client invocations with XML encoding were using the wrong content type ("application/xml+fhir"
				instead
				of the correct "application/atom+xml"). Thanks to David Hay of Orion Health for surfacing this one!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Bundle entries now support a link type of "search". Thanks to David Hay for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="1">
				If a client receives a non 2xx response (e.g. HTTP 500) and the response body is a text/plain message or
				an OperationOutcome resource, include the message in the exception message so that it will be
				more conveniently displayed in logs and other places. Thanks to Neal Acharya for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="2">
				Read invocations in the client now process the "Content-Location" header and use it to
				populate the ID of the returned resource. Thanks to Neal Acharya for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="3">
				Fix issue where vread invocations on server incorrectly get routed to instance history method if one is
				defined. Thanks to Neal Acharya from UHN for surfacing this one!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Binary reads on a server not include the Content-Disposition header, to prevent HTML in binary
				blobs from being used for nefarious purposes. See

			<action type="add">
				Support has been added for using an HTTP proxy for outgoing requests.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Fix: Primitive extensions declared against custom resource types
				are encoded even if they have no value. Thanks to David Hay of Orion for
				reporting this!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Fix: RESTful server deployed to a location where the URL to access it contained a
				space (e.g. a WAR file with a space in the name) failed to work correctly.

			<action type="add">
				<![CDATA[<b>BREAKING CHANGE:</b>]]>: IdDt has been modified so that it
				contains a partial or complete resource identity. Previously it contained
				only the simple alphanumeric id of the resource (the part at the end of the "read" URL for
				that resource) but it can now contain a complete URL or even a partial URL (e.g. "Patient/123")
				and can optionally contain a version (e.g. "Patient/123/_history/456"). New methods have
				been added to this datatype which provide just the numeric portion. See the JavaDoc
				for more information.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				<![CDATA[<b>API CHANGE:</b>]]>: Most elements in the HAPI FHIR model contain
				a getId() and setId() method. This method is confusing because it is only actually used
				for IDREF elements (which are rare) but its name makes it easy to confuse with more
				important identifiers. For this reason, these methods have been deprecated and replaced with
				get/setElementSpecificId() methods. The old methods will be removed at some point. Resource
				types are unchanged and retain their get/setId methods.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Allow use of QuantityDt as a service parameter to support the "quantity" type. Previously
				QuantityDt did not implement IQueryParameterType so it was not valid, and there was no way to
				support quantity search parameters on the server (e.g. Observation.value-quantity)
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Introduce StringParameter type which can be used as a RESTful operation search parameter
				type. StringParameter allows ":exact" matches to be specified in clients, and handled in servers.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Parsers (XML/JSON) now support deleted entries in bundles
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Transaction method now supported in servers
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Support for Binary resources added (in servers, clients, parsers, etc.)
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Support for Query resources fixed (in parser)
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Nested contained resources (e.g. encoding a resource with a contained resource that itself contains a
				resource)
				now parse and encode correctly, meaning that all contained resources are placed in the "contained" element
				of the root resource, and the parser looks in the root resource for all container levels when stitching
				contained resources back together.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Server methods with @Include parameter would sometimes fail when no _include was actually
				specified in query strings.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Client requests for IdentifierDt types (such as Patient.identifier) did not create the correct
				query string if the system is null.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add support for paging responses from RESTful servers.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Don't fail on narrative blocks in JSON resources with only an XML declaration but no content (these are
				produced by the Health Intersections server)
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Server now automatically compresses responses if the client indicates support
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Server failed to support optional parameters when type is String and :exact qualifier is used
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Read method in client correctly populated resource ID in returned object
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Support added for deleted-entry by/name, by/email, and comment from Tombstones spec
