# We cannot store things like gpg passwords and sonatype credentials as plain text within the 
# pipeline's yaml file, so we've created variable groups in our library to store sensitive variables.
# Pipelines do not load these groups by default, and we need to define which groups to load before
# running any steps.

steps:

  # We need a valid signing key to sign our builds for deployment to sonatype. We have uploaded
  # both our private and public keys to Azure as 'secure files' that we load into individual pipelines.

  # 1. Load the public key file
  - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
    displayName: 'Load public key from secure files.'
    inputs:
      secureFile: public.pgp

  # 2. Load the private key file
  - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
    displayName: 'Load private key from secure files.'
    inputs:
      secureFile: private.pgp

  # Although we have imported the key files into our workspace, GPG has no knowledge that these keys exist.
  # We use a bash script to import both the private and puablic keys into gpg for future signing.

  # 3. Import keys into gpg
  - bash: |
      gpg --import --no-tty --batch --yes $(Agent.TempDirectory)/public.pgp
      gpg --import --no-tty --batch --yes $(Agent.TempDirectory)/private.pgp
      gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG
      gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
    displayName: 'Import signing keys into gpg.'
  
  # For creating a snapshot release with maven, we need to build a fake settings.xml file locally where
  # we can set our credentials for both sonatype and gpg. Then maven can read
  # for it to read from. This is done for the master branch merges only.

  # 4. Create local settings.xml file
