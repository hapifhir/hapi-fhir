/**
 * Provides server ports that are free, in order for tests to use them
 *
 * <p><b>
 * This class is ONLY designed for unit-testing usage, as it holds on to server ports
 * for a long time (potentially lots of them!) and will leave your system low on
 * ports if you put it into production.
 * </b></p>
 * <p>
 * How it works:
 * <p>
 * We have lots of tests that need a free port because they want to open up
 * a server, and need the port to be unique and unused so that the tests can
 * run multithreaded. This turns out to just be an awful problem to solve for
 * lots of reasons:
 * <p>
 * 1. You can request a free port from the OS by calling <code>new ServerSocket(0);</code>
 * and this seems to work 99% of the time, but occasionally on a heavily loaded
 * server if two processes ask at the exact same time they will receive the
 * same port assignment, and one will fail.
 * 2. Tests run in separate processes, so we can't just rely on keeping a collection
 * of assigned ports or anything like that.
 * <p>
 * So we solve this like this:
 * <p>
 * At random, this class will pick a "control port" and bind it. A control port
 * is just a randomly chosen port that is a multiple of 100. If we can bind
 * successfully to that port, we now own the range of "n+1 to n+99". If we can't
 * bind that port, it means some other process has probably taken it so
 * we'll just try again until we find an available control port.
 * <p>
 * Assuming we successfully bind a control port, we'll give out any available
 * ports in the range "n+1 to n+99" until we've exhausted the whole set, and
 * then we'll pick another control port (if we actually get asked for over
 * 100 ports.. this should be a rare event).
 * <p>
 * This mechanism has the benefit of (fingers crossed) being bulletproof
 * in terms of its ability to give out ports that are actually free, thereby
 * preventing random test failures.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism has the drawback of never giving up a control port once
 * it has assigned one. To be clear, this class is deliberately leaking
 * resources. Again, no production use!
