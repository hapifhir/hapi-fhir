/**
 * This Represents an <b>HTTP 403 Forbidden</b> response, which generally indicates one of two conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Authentication was provided, but the authenticated user is not permitted to perform the requested operation.</li>
 * <li>The operation is forbidden to all users. Repeating the request with authentication would serve no purpose.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For security failures, you should use
 * {@link AuthenticationException} if you want to indicate that the
 * user could not be authenticated (e.g. credential failures), also 
 * known as an <b>authentication</b> failure. 
 * You should use {@link ForbiddenOperationException} if you want to 
 * indicate that the authenticated user does not have permission to
 * perform the requested operation, also known as an <b>authorization</b>
 * failure.
