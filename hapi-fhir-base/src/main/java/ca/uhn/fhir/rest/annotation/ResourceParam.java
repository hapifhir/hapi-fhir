/**
 * Denotes a parameter for a REST method which will contain the resource actually
 * being created/updated/etc in an operation which contains a resource in the HTTP request.
 * <p>
 * For example, in a {@link Create} operation the method parameter annotated with this
 * annotation will contain the actual resource being created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Parameters with this annotation should typically be of the type of resource being
 * operated on (see below for an exception when raw data is required). For example, in a
 * IResourceProvider for Patient resources, the parameter annotated with this
 * annotation should be of type Patient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that in servers it is also acceptable to have parameters with this annotation
 * which are of type {@link String} or of type <code>byte[]</code>. Parameters of
 * these types will contain the raw/unparsed HTTP request body. It is fine to
 * have multiple parameters with this annotation, so you can have one parameter
 * which accepts the parsed resource, and another which accepts the raw request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that this parameter may be null if a client does not supply a body.
 * </p>
