 * XML Dsig
 
 * 



 * Add SimpleSetters for all primitive datatypes
 
 * Implement and add Simple Getters in a similar way to simple setters
 
 * Add support for modifierExtensions
 
 * Add client and server support for other operations from 
   the list here (we currently support read, vread, and search
   but there are many more): http://latest.fhir.me/http.html 
   
 * Get resource references working on both client and server - for the
   client, maybe allow lazy-loading or something?
   
 * Support compartments for client and server
 
 * Support slices in the model
 
 * Support extensions (declared and undeclared) in primitives, narratives, etc. 
 
 * Create a Maven archetype for a server project and a client project
 
 * Support "Binary" resource, which is a special resource type
 
 * Javadocs for getters/setters of IDatatype (e.g. Observation#getApplies()) should 
   include a list of the types that are allowed (and maybe a check?) or maybe some custom
   getters and setters or something
 
---------
Issues:

 * Submit _narrative parameter as enhancement suggestion

 * Need to be able to bind Identifier.system to a set of allowable values in a profile. Graeme
   has suggested making value[x] repeatable in the profile definition
   
 * Would like a standardized (but optional) HTTP parameter for pretty-printing. Suggest: _pretty=true
 
 * Example-patient-general.xml/json has <reference value="Organization/1"/> but "resource":"Organization/1"
