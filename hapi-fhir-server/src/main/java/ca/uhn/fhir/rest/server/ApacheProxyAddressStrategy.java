/**
 * Works like the normal {@link ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server.IncomingRequestAddressStrategy} unless there's an x-forwarded-host present, in which case that's used in place of the server's address.
 *	<p>
 * If the Apache Http Server <code>mod_proxy</code> isn't configured to supply <code>x-forwarded-proto</code>, the factory method that you use to create the address strategy will determine the default. Note that
 * <code>mod_proxy</code> doesn't set this by default, but it can be configured via <code>RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto http</code> (or https)
 *	</p>
 *	<p>
 * If you want to set the protocol based on something other than the constructor argument, you should be able to do so by overriding <code>protocol</code>.
 *	</p>
 *	<p>
 * Note that while this strategy was designed to work with Apache Http Server, and has been tested against it, it should work with any proxy server that sets <code>x-forwarded-host</code>
 * </p>
