TODO:
  In answer lists, figure out what to do with externally defined lists

Comments for Loinc:

Overall
- ValueSet and ConceptMap resources have a spot for copyright and
  contact information. Are there official values for these?

Answer Lists
- Per the notes, there is no way in FHIR currently to map answer lists to
  codes based on context. For this reason, I am ignoring any entries in
  LoincAnswerListLink_Beta_1.csv where the "ApplicableContext" context is
  not empty. Is this correct?

Parts
- Only parts with a status of "ACTIVE" are being imported, any others are
  ignored.
- The PartTypeName (e.g. "ADJUSTMENT") is ignored as there is no corresponding
  property in loinc.xml
- PartDisplayName is not mapped
- Part links are not currently processed (it's not clear to me how to model
  these in FHIR, as CodeSystem.hierarchyMeaning has to be only one of 'is-a'
  or 'part-of' and presumably the 'is-a' relationship is more important.

Part Mappings
- I have made LOINC the source and SCT the target for the mappings in the
  ConceptMap resource. Does this seem like the appropriate orientation?
- A canonical URI should be defined for the LOINC->SCT mapping ConceptMap
  resource. I have hardcoded "http://loinc.org/loinc-to-snomed" for now, but
  we should discuss what is appropriate.

RSNA Playbook
- A canonical URI should be defined for the "all RSNA playbook codes" ValueSet.
  I have hardcoded "http://loinc.org/rsna-codes" for now but we should discuss
  what is appropriate.
- A name for the "RSNA Playbook" ValueSet is needed.
- Just to confirm, the "all RSNA playbook codes" ValueSet should contain the
  loinc codes (e.g. "17787-3") and not the part codes (e.g. "LP199995-4")?
- A codesystem URI for radlex RID and RPID codes is needed (currently
  "http://rid" and "http://rpid" are used as placeholders since I'm assuming
  these exist somewhere.
- For mappings from loinc part codes to RadLex RIDs, are the codes considered
  equivalent (or would they be wider/narrower). They look equivalent to me.

Document Ontology
- Per the SOW, "A value set containing terms in the LOINC Document Ontology
  will be created". Just to confirm, entries in this ValueSet are therefore
  LOINC terms (such as "11488-4 / Consultation Note") as opposed to part
  codes?
- Need to define a URI for the document ontology ValueSet. Currently I am
  using "http://loinc.org/document-ontology-codes"

Top 2000
- Need to define a URI for both ValueSets. Currently I am using
  "http://loinc.org/top-2000-lab-results-us" and
  "http://loinc.org/top-2000-lab-results-si"

Universal Order Set
- Need to define a URI for this ValueSet - Currenty using "http://loinc.org/fhir/loinc-universal-order-set"
