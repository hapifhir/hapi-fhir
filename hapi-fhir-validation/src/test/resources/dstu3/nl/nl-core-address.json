This format defines a superset that is the basis for all addresses around the world and adds all relevant components to express Dutch addresses.\r\n\r\nA Dutch Address is a proper FHIR Address. Systems that do not understand any of the extensions, will be able to render and work with a Dutch address. Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.\r\n\r\nThe HCIM defines certain address types in the AdresSoortCodelijst. These do not all have a one to one mapping in the FHIR Address datatype. The following explains how to deal with that. In addition, there are the ConceptMaps http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse and http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType to define this relationship\r\n\r\nHCIM Postal Address maps to Address.type 'postal'; \r\n\r\nHCIM Primary Home Address maps to Address.extension:official 'true' + Address.use 'home' + Address.use.extension 'HP'; \r\n\r\nHCIM Visit Address (Woon-/verblijfadres) maps to Address.use 'home' + Address.type 'physical' + Address.use.extension 'PHYS'; \r\n\r\nHCIM Temporary Address maps to Address.use 'temp'; \r\n\r\nHCIM Work Place Address maps to Address.use 'work';  \r\n\r\nHCIM Vacation Home Address maps to Address.use 'temp' + Address.use.extension 'HV'.\r\n\r\nIf Address.type is \"both\" then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical). Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.","alias":["AdresInformatie"],"example":[{"label":"Example of a vacation home address","valueAddress":{"extension":[{"url":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official","valueBoolean":false}],"use":"temp","_use":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-AD-use","valueCode":"HV"}]},"line":["Binnenkant 12A Hoog"],"_line":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-streetName","valueString":"Binnenkant"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-houseNumber","valueString":"12"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-buildingNumberSuffix","valueString":"A"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-unitID","valueString":"Hoog"}]}],"city":"Amsterdam","state":"NH","postalCode":"1000AA","country":"NLD"}},{"label":"Example of a primary home address","valueAddress":{"extension":[{"url":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official","valueBoolean":true}],"use":"home","line":["Binnenkant to 10"],"_line":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-streetName","valueString":"Binnenkant"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-additionalLocator","valueString":"to"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-houseNumber","valueString":"10"}]}],"city":"Amsterdam","state":"NH","postalCode":"1001AA","country":"NLD"}}],"condition":["nl-streetname-if-official-and-other-line-parts"],"constraint":[{"key":"nl-streetname-if-official-and-other-line-parts","requirements":"This constraint checks conformance against the Dutch BRP constraints on address parts.
