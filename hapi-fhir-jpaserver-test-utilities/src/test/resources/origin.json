Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody - a type of protein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) alpha. Remsima belongs to a group of medicines called ‘TNF blockers’. It is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:</p><ul><li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li><li>Psoriatic arthritis</li><li>Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew’s disease)</li><li>Psoriasis</li><li>Crohn’s disease</li><li>Ulcerative colitis.</li></ul><p>Remsima works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved in inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body.</p><p><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima which you will take with another medicine called methotrexate to:</p><ul><li>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</li><li>slow down the damage in your joints,</li><li>improve your physical function.</li></ul><p><strong>Psoriatic arthritis</strong>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima to:</p><ul><li>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</li><li>slow down the damage in your joints,</li><li>improve your physical function.</li></ul><p><strong>Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew’s disease)</strong>Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima to:</p><ul><li>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</li><li>improve your physical function.</li></ul><p><strong>Psoriasis</strong>Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, you will first be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or treatments do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima to treat your disease.</p><p><strong>Crohn’s disease</strong></p><p>Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remsima to:</p><ul><li>treat active Crohn’s disease,</li><li>reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that have not been controlled by other medicines or surgery</li></ul></div>"

Cases of TB have been reported in patients treated with infliximab, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for TB. Your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card.</li><li>If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB before you are given Remsima. Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Remsima. Signs include persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats.</li></ul><p><strong>Hepatitis B virus</strong></p><ul><li>Tell your doctor before you are using Remsima if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have ever had it.</li><li>Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B.</li><li>Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus.</li><li>Treatment with TNF blockers such as Remsima may result in reactivation of hepatitis B virus in patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases.</li><li>If you experience reactivation of hepatitis B, your doctor may need to stop your treatment and may give you medicines such as effective antiviral therapy with supportive treatment.</li></ul><p><strong>Heart problems</strong></p><ul><li>Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure.</li><li>Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart. Tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during treatment with Remsima. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet.</li></ul><p><strong>Cancer and lymphoma</strong></p><ul><li>Tell your doctor before you are given Remsima if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer.</li><li>Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher risk of developing lymphoma.</li><li>Patients taking Remsima may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer.</li><li>Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including infliximab have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were teenage boys or young men and most had either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. This type of cancer has usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received medicines containing azathioprine or mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers.</li><li>Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If there are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor.</li><li>Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab have developed cervical cancer.

You may receive some vaccines during treatment with Remsima but you should not receive live vaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using Remsima because they may cause infections.</li><li>If you received Remsima while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for getting an infection as a result of receiving a live vaccine during the first year of life. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Remsima use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live vaccines such as the BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis).</li><li>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Remsima use before your baby is given any vaccine. For more information see section on Pregnancy and breast-feeding.</li></ul><p><strong>Therapeutic infectious agents</strong></p><ul><li>Talk to your doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of cancer)</li></ul><p><strong>Operations or dental procedures</strong></p><ul><li>Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures.</li><li>Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Remsima by showing them your patient reminder card.</li></ul><p><strong>Liver problems</strong></p><ul><li>Some patients receiving infliximab have developed serious liver problems.</li><li>Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with Remsima.

Signs include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.</li></ul><p><strong>Children and adolescents</strong></p><p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because there are no data that show that this medicine is safe and works in this age group.</p><p><strong>Other medicines and Remsima</strong></p><p>Patients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These medicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep using while you are having Remsima.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including any other medicines to treat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and herbal medicines.</p><p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines:</p><ul><li>Medicines that affect your immune system.</li><li>Kineret (which contains anakinra). Remsima and Kineret should not be used together.</li><li>Orencia (which contains abatacept). Remsima and Orencia should not be used together. While using Remsima you should not receive live vaccines.

Remsima should only be used during pregnancy or while breast-feeding if your doctor feels it is necessary for you.</li><li>You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Remsima and for 6 months after you stop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with your doctor.</li><li>If you received Remsima during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection.</li><li>It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Remsima use before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Remsima while pregnant, giving BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 12 months after birth may result in infection with serious complications, including death. Live vaccines such as the BCG vaccine should not be given to your baby within 12 months after birth, unless your baby’s doctor recommends otherwise. For more information see section on vaccination.</li><li>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Remsima use before your baby is given any vaccine. Live vaccines should not be given to your baby while you are breast-feeding unless your baby’s doctor recommends otherwise.</li><li>Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to women treated with infliximab during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or infections, contact your baby’s doctor immediately.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong></p><p>Remsima is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy, or unwell after having Remsima, do not drive or use any tools or machines.</p><p><strong>Remsima contains sodium and sorbitol</strong></p><p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’ and 45 mg sorbitol in each 120 mg dose.</p></div>"
