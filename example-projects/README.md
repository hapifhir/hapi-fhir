# Unsupported

Most of the projects in this module are no longer supported.

The test in hapi-fhir-jpaserver-cds-example is @Disabledd until Chris Schuler is able to make a change to the pom
this module depends on.

## Supported JPA Example:

The supported HAPI-FHIR JPA example is available in the [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter)
project within the [hapifhir](https://github.com/hapifhir) GitHub Organization.
