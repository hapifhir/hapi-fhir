  Note: the schemas &amp; schematrons do not contain all of the rules about what makes resources
  valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and with
  any profiles that apply to the resources in order to make a conformant implementation.

Given that the Binary resource contains very few elements that can be used to determine the sensitivity of the data and relationships to individuals, the referenced resource stands in as a proxy equivalent for this purpose. This referenced resource may be related to the Binary (e.g. Media, DocumentReference), or may be some non-related Resource purely as a security proxy. E.g. to identify that the binary resource relates to a patient, and access should only be granted to applications that have access to the patient.</xs:documentation>
